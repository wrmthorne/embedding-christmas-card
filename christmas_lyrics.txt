O Come, All Ye Faithful

O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant,
Come ye, O come ye, to Bethlehem.
Come and behold Him, born the King of angels;

Refrain

O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.

True God of true God, Light from Light Eternal,
Lo, he shuns not the Virgin's womb;
Son of the Father, begotten, not created;

Refrain

Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation;
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above!
Glory to God, all glory in the highest;

Refrain

See how the shepherds, summoned to His cradle,
Leaving their flocks, draw nigh to gaze;
We too will thither bend our joyful footsteps;

Refrain

Child, for us sinners poor and in the manger,
We would embrace Thee, with love and awe;
Who would not love Thee, loving us so dearly?

Refrain

Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning;
Jesus, to Thee be glory given;
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing.

Refrain


Angels, From the Realms of Glory
Angels, from the realms of glory,
Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
Ye, who sang creation's story,
Now proclaim Messiah's birth:
Come and worship,
Come and worship
Worship Christ, the new-born King.
Shepherds in the field abiding,
Watching o'er your flocks by night,
God with man is now residing;
Yonder shines the infant Light:
Sages, leave your contemplations,
Brighter visions beam afar:
Seek the great Desire of nations;
Ye have seen his natal star:
Saints before the altar bending,
Watching long in hope and fear,
Suddenly the Lord, descending,
In his temple shall appear.

The First Noel

The first Noel, the angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East, beyond them far;
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

And by the light of that same star,
Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

This star drew night to the northwest,
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest;
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

Then entered in those wise men three,
Full reverently upon their knee;
And offered there in his presence,
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

Good Christian Men, Rejoice
Good Christian men, rejoice,
With heart and soul, and voice;
Give ye heed to what we say:
Jesus Christ is born to-day;
Ox and ass before him bow,
And he is in the manger now.
Christ is born to-day!
Christ is born to-day!
Good Christian men, rejoice,
With heart and soul, and voice;
Now ye hear of endless bliss:
Jesus Christ was born for this!
He hath oped the heavenly door,
And man is blessed evermore.
Christ was born for this!
Christ was born for this!
Good Christian men, rejoice,
With heart and soul, and voice;
Now ye need not fear the grave:
Jesus Christ was born to save!
Calls you one and calls you all
To gain his everlasting hall.
Christ was born to save!
Christ was born to save!

What Child Is This?
What child is this, who, laid to rest,
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring him laud,
The babe, the son of Mary.
Why lies he in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian, fear: for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.
So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come, peasant, king, to own him.
the King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone him.

God Rest You Merry Gentlemen
God rest you merry, gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay,
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas Day;
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy!
From God our heavenly Father
A blessed angel came;
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tiding of the same;
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name.
"Fear not, then," said the angel,
"Let nothing you affright;
This day is born a Savior
Of a pure virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in him
From Satan's power and might."
Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
this holy tide of Christmas
Doth bring redeeming grace.

Angels We Have Heard on High
Angels we have heard on high,
Singing sweetly through the night,
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their brave delight.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why these songs of happy cheer?
What great brightness did you see?
What glad tiding did you hear?
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ, the Lord, the new-born King.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
See him in a manger laid
Whom the angels praise above;
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
While we raise our hearts in love.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.

Away in a Manger
Away in a manger, no crib for his bed,
the little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.
The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
but little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
It came upon the midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold:
"Peace on the earth, good will to men,
From heaven's all-gracious King."
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.
Still through the cloven skies they come
With peaceful wings unfurled,
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world;
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel-sounds
The blessed angels sing.
Yet with the woes of sin and strife
The world has suffered long;
Beneath the heavenly strain have rolled
Two thousand years of wrong;
And man, at war with man, hears not
The tidings which they bring;
O hush the noise, ye men of strife,
And hear the angels sing!
O ye, beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow,
Look now! for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing;
O rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing!
For lo! the days are hastening on,
By prophets seen of old,
When with the ever-circling years
Shall come the time foretold,
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling,
And the whole world give back the song
Which now the angels sing.

O Christmas Tree
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree!
How are thy leaves so verdant!
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
How are thy leaves so verdant!
Not only in the summertime,
But even in winter is thy prime.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
How are thy leaves so verdant!
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Much pleasure doth thou bring me!
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Much pleasure doth thou bring me!
For every year the Christmas tree,
Brings to us all both joy and glee.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Much pleasure doth thou bring me!
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Thy candles shine out brightly!
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Thy candles shine out brightly!
Each bough doth hold its tiny light,
That makes each toy to sparkle bright.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Thy candles shine out brightly!

O Little Town of Bethlehem
O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see the lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee to-night.
For Christ is born of Mary,
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.
How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven.
No ear may hear his coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him, still
The dear Christ enters in.
Where children pure and happy
Pray to the blessed Child,
Where misery cries out to thee,
Son of the mother mild;
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door,
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
And Christmas comes once more.
O holy Child of Bethlehem!
Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin and enter in,
Be born in us to-day.
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell;
O come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel!

Silent Night
Silent night, holy night,
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child.
Holy infant so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Silent night, holy night,
Shepherds quake at the sight,
Glories stream from heaven afar,
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia;
Christ the Savior, is born!
Christ the Savior, is born!
Silent night, holy night,
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth.
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth.

Rudolf the Red-nosed Reindeer
Rudolf, the red-nosed reindeer
had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw him,
you would even say it glows.
All of the other reindeer
used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor Rudolf
play in any reindeer games.
Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say:
"Rudolf with your nose so bright,
won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then all the reindeer loved him
as they shouted out with glee:
"Rudolf the red-nosed reindeer,
you'll go down in history!"

Hark! The Herald Angels Sing
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born King!

Join the triumph of the skies;

Christ is born in Bethlehem!
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born King!
Christ, by highest heaven adored;
Christ, the everlasting Lord;
Late in time behold him come,
Offspring of the Virgin's womb.
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
Hail the incarnate Deity,
Pleased as man with man to dwell;
Jesus, our Emmanuel!
Mild he lays his glory by,
Born that man no more may die,
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth.
Risen with healing in his wings,
Light and life to all he brings,
Hail, the Sun of Righteousness!
Hail, the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
Hail the Heaven-born Prince of Peace
Hail the Son of Righteousness
Light and life to all He brings
Risen with healing in His wings
Mild He lay His glory by
Born that man no more may die

Come Desire of Nations come,
Fix in us thy humble home.
Rise, the woman's conquering Seed,
Bruise in us the serpent's head.
Adam's likeness now efface
Stamp thine image in its place

Good King Wenceslas
Good King Wenceslas looked out
on the feast of Stephen,
when the snow lay round about,
deep and crisp and even.
Brightly shown the moon that night,
though the frost was cruel,
when a poor man came in sight,
gathering winter fuel.
Hither, page, and stand by me.
If thou know it telling:
yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
underneath the mountain,
right against the forest fence
by Saint Agnes fountain.
Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
Bring me pine logs hither.
Thou and I will see him dine
when we bear the thither.
Page and monarch, forth they went,
forth they went together
through the rude wind's wild lament
and the bitter weather.
Sire, the night is darker now,
and the wind blows stronger.
Fails my heart, I know not how.
I can go no longer.
Ark my footsteps my good page,
tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
freeze thy blood less coldly.
In his master's step he trod,
where the snow lay dented.
Heat was in the very sod
which the saint had printed.
Therefore, Christian men, be sure,
wealth or rank possessing,
ye who now will bless the poor
shall yourselves find blessing.

I Saw Three Ships
I saw three ships come sailing in
on Christmas Day, on Christmas Day.
I saw three ships come sailing in
on Christmas Day in the morning.
And what was in those ships all three
on Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?
And what was in those ships all three
on Christmas Day in the morning?
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there
on Christmas Day, on Christmas Day.
The virgin Mary and Christ were there
on Christmas Day in the morning.

Joy to the World
Joy to the world! the Lord is come;
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
and heaven and nature sing,
and heaven and nature sing,
and heaven, and heaven and nature sing.
Joy to the earth! the Savior reigns;
Let men their songs employ;
while fields and floods,
rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.
No more let sins and sorrows grow,
nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessing flow
far as the curse is found,
far as the curse is found,
far as, far as the curse is found.
He rules the world with truth and grace,
and makes the nations prove
the glories of His righteousness,
and wonders of His love,
and wonders of His love,
and wonders, wonders of His love.

O Holy Night
O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O holy night, O night divine!
O night, O holy night, O night divine!
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!


Carol of the Bells
Carol of the Bells is an adaptation of an ancient Ukrainian folk song
called a "shchedrivka".  An arrangement by Mykola Leontovych (1877-1921)
was popularized in the 1930's by Oleksander Koshyts (1875-1944), a
Ukrainian choir director who worked in the US and Canada.  It has since
become an American Christmas classic.

    Hark how the bells,
    sweet silver bells,
    all seem to say,
    throw cares away
    Christmas is here,
    bringing good cheer,
    to young and old,
    meek and the bold,
    ding dong ding
    that is their song
    with joyful ring
    all caroling

    one seems to hear
    words of good cheer
    from everywhere
    filling the air
    Oh how they pound,
    raising the sound,
    o'er hill and dale,
    telling their tale,
    Gaily they ring
    while people sing
    songs of good cheer,
    Christmas is here,
    Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas,
    Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas,
    On on they send ,
    on without end,
    their joyful tone to every home
    Dong Ding dong ding, dong Bong

Christ Is Born In Bethlehem
Christ, by highest heaven adored
Christ, the everlasting Lord;
Late in time behold Him come
Offspring of a virgin's womb.
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
Hail th' Incarnate Deity,
Pleased as man with man to dwell;
Jesus, our Emmanuel.

Come, Desire of nations come,
Fix in us Thy humble home;
Rise, the Woman's conquering Seed,
Bruise in us the Serpent's head.
Adam's likeness, Lord efface:
Stamp Thy image in its place;
Second Adam, from above,
Reinstate us in thy love.

Hail, the heav'n-born Prince of Peace!
Hail, the Son of Righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings,
Ris'n with healing in His wings.
Mild He lays His glory by,
Born that man no more may die,
Born to raise the sons of earth,

Christmas Without You
Words and Music by Dolly Parton and Steve Goldstein
White Christmas and I'm blue
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
The fireplace keeps burning and my thoughts keep turning
The pages of memories of time spent with you
Old Christmas songs we knew and used to make love to
Make it hard to get used to
Christmas without you
Chorus:
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you I miss you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you
Like a mystery with no clues
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
The sweetest gift I know would be if the new snow
Could fall on your footsteps on this Christmas eve
The most joyous Christmas if luck could be with us
Would be if Saint Nicholas brought you home to me
Repeat chorus twice

The Coventry Carol
Lullaby, thou little tiny child,
By, by, lullay, lullay
Lullay, thou little tiny child,
By, by, lullay, lullay.

O sisters too, how may we do,
For to preserve this day,
This poor youngling for whom we sing,
By, by, lullay, lullay.

Herod the king in his ragin,
Charged he hath this day,
His men of night, in his own sight,
All children young to stay.

Then woe is me, poor child, for thee,
And ever mourn and say,
For thy parting not say, nor sing,
By, by, lullay, lullay.

Mary's Boy Child
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.

Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible say,
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

While shepherds watch their flocks by night,
they see a bright new shining star,
they hear a choir sing a song, the music seemed to come from afar.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.

Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out
there were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted
"let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace".

Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night,
they found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight.

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn,
and in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out
there were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted
"let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace".

Oh my Lord...

With Bells On
-Words By Dolly Parton
I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the trees and wrap the presents
turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on

I've traveled around this country crossed the waters deep and wide
Made lots of friends and memories brought joy to others lives
It's Christmas time again another year has come and gone
And I can't keep from wonderin' how the old folks are at home

I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on

When the snow is on the meadow and the sleigh bells jingle bright
And the kids are singing jingle bells around the Christmas lights
As daddy stokes the fire and mama puts the turkey on
There ain't nothing going to slow me down this Christmas I'll be home

I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on

Angels and Shepherds
(Morovia - Nesem Ván Noviny)

Hark all ye shepherds, come join in our song.
Hark all ye shepherds, for Jesus is born.
Lo he is lying, born in a manger,
Jesus, annointed to be our Savior. Alleluia!

Hark all ye shepherds, arise from your sheep.
Hark all ye shepherds, the Christ child asleep.
Mary, the mother, quietly singing,
From God to man salvation is bringing. Alleluia!

Angels adore him, men bow before him, heaven and earth proclaim!
Prophets of old his coming foretold and men ever praise his name.
Come and adore him, Jesus our Savior,
He dwells among us, now and forever. Alleluia!

Children, Go Where I Send Thee
Children, go where I send thee
How shall I send thee?
I'm gonna send thee one by one
One for the little bitty baby
That was born, born
Born in Bethlehem.
Children, go where I send thee
How shall I send thee?
I'm gonna send thee two by two
Two for Paul and Silas
One for the little bitty baybe
That was born, born
Born in Bethlehem.
Three for the Hebrew children...
Four for the four that stood at the door...
Five for the gospel preachers...
Six for the six that never got fixed...
Seven for the seven that never got to heaven...
Eight for the eight that stood at the gate...
Nine for the nine all dressed so fine...
Ten for the ten commandments...
Eleven for the eleven deriders...
Twelve for the twelve Apostles...

Home for the Holidays
Al Stillman and Robert Allen
Oh, there’s no place like
home for the holidays,
‘Cause no matter how far away you roam
When you pine for the sunshine
Of a friendly face
For the holidays, you can’t beat
Home, sweet home
I met a man who lives in Tennessee
And he was headin’ for Pennsylvania
And some home made pumpkin pie
From Pennsylvania folks a travelin’ down
To Dixie’s sunny shore
From Atlantic to Pacific, gee
The traffic is terrific
Oh there's no place like home
For the holidays, ‘cause no matter
How far away you roam
If you want
To be happy in a million ways
For the holidays, you can’t beat
Home, sweet home

Willie, take your little drum,
Robin, bring your fife, and come,
And be merry while you play.

More in tune than fife and drum,
So be merry while you play.

The Huron Carol
'Twas in the moon of winter-time
When all the birds had fled,
That mighty Gitchi Manitou
Sent angel choirs instead;
Before their light the stars grew dim,
And wandering hunter heard the hymn:
"Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born,
In excelsis gloria."
 Within a lodge of broken bark
The tender Babe was found,
A ragged robe of rabbit skin
Enwrapp'd His beauty round;
But as the hunter braves drew nigh,
The angel song rang loud and high... Refrain
 O children of the forest free,
O sons of Manitou,
The Holy Child of earth and heaven
Is born today for you.
Come kneel before the radiant Boy
Who brings you beauty, peace and joy. Refrain

In Excelsis Gloria
When Christ was born of Mary free,
In Bethlehem in that fair city,
Angels sung e'er with mirth and glee,
In excelsis gloria,
In excelsis gloria,
In excelsis gloria,
In excelsis gloria.
 Herdsmen beheld these angels bright-
To them appeared with great light,
And said, "God's son is born this night." Refrain
 This King is come to save His kind,
In the Scripture as we find;
Therefore this song we have in mind: Refrain
 Then, dear Lord, for Thy great grace,
Grant us the bliss to see Thy face,
Where we may sing to Thy solace: Refrain

Fum, Fum, Fum,
Spanish
On this joyful Christmas Day
Sing fum, fum, fum
On this joyful Christmas Day
Sing fum, fum, fum
For a blessed Babe was born
Upon this day at the break of morn
In a manger poor and lowly
Lay the Son of God most holy
Fum, Fum, Fum!

Thanks to God for holidays
Sing fum, fum, fum
Now we all our voices raise
And sing a song of grateful praise
Celebrate in song and story
All the wonders of His glory
Fum, fum, fum

The Greatest Gift of All
John Jarvis
Dawn is slowly breaking
Our friends have all gone home
You and I are waiting
For Santa Claus to come

There's a present by the tree
Stockings on the wall
Knowing you're in love with me
Is the greatest gift of all

The fire is slowly fading
Chill is in the air
All the gifts are waiting
For children ev'rywhere

Through the window I can see
Snow begin to fall
Knowing you're in love with me
Is the greatest gift of all

Just before I go to sleep
I hear a church bell ring
Merry Christmas ev'ryone
Is the song it sings

So I say a silent prayer
For creatures great and small
Peace on earth goodwill to men
Is the greatest gift of all
Peace on earth goodwill to men
Is the greatest gift of all

Greensleeves
William Chatterdon Dixs
Version 1 & 2
What child is this, who, lay to rest,
on Mary's lap, is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
while Shepards watch are keeping

Chorus

This, this is Christ the King
whom Shepards guard and angels sing
Haste, Haste, to bring him laud,
The babe, the son of Mary

Why lies he in such mean estate
where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian, fear; for sinners
here the silent Word is pleading

Chorus

So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh come,
peasant, King, to own him;
The King of kings salvation brings,
let loving hearts enthrone Him

Chorus
Version 2
Alas, my love, you do me wrong,
To cast me off discourteously
For I have loved you well and long,
Delighting in your company

Greensleeves was all my joy
Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves was my heart of gold,
And who but my lady greensleeves

Your vows you've broken, like my heart,
Oh, why did you so enrapture me?
Now I remain in a world apart
But my heart remains in captivity

I have been ready at your hand,
To grant whatever you would crave,
I have both wagered life and land,
Your love and good-will for to have

If you intend thus to disdain,
It does the more enrapture me,
And even so, I still remain
A lover in captivity

My men were clothed all in green,
And they did ever wait on thee;
All this was gallant to be seen,
And yet thou wouldst not love me

Thou couldst desire no earthly thing,
but still thou hadst it readily
Thy music still to play and sing;
And yet thou wouldst not love me

Well, I will pray to God on high,
that thou my constancy mayst see,
And that yet once before I die,
Thou wilt vouchsafe to love me

Ah, Greensleeves, now farewell, adieu,
To God I pray to prosper thee,
For I am still thy lover true,
Come once again and love me

(Do They Know It's Christmas?)
Band Aid Christmas Song
M. Ure and Bob Geldof
It's Christmastime; there's no need to be afraid
At Christmastime, we let in light and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime
But say a prayer to pray for the other ones
At Christmastime

It's hard, but when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears

And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime

The greatest gift they'll get this year is life
Oh, where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?

Here's to you, raise a glass for ev'ryone
Here's to them, underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?

Feed the world
Feed the world

Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmastime again
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmastime again

The Night Before Christmas
Clement Clarke Moore - adapted by Johnny Marks
Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
All the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hope that Saint Nicholas soon would be there.
Then, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
A miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,
A little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.
And more rapid than eagles his reindeer all came
As he shouted, "Oh Dasher" and each reindeer's name.
And so up to the housetop the reindeer soon flew
With the sleigh full of toys and Saint Nicholas, too.
Down the chimney he came with a leap and a bound;
He was dressed all in fur, and his belly was round.
He spoke not a word but went straight to this work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
Then giving a nod up the chimney he rose.
But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight,
"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"

Suzy Snowflake
Sid Tepper and Roy C. Bennett
Here comes Suzy Snowflake,
Dressed in a snow-white gown,
Tap, tap, tappin' at your windowpane
To tell you she's in town.

Here comes Suzy Snowflake;
Soon you will hear her say,
"Come out ev'ryone and play with me;
I haven't long to stay.

If you want to make a snowman,
I'll help you make one, two, three.
If you wanna take a sleigh ride,
The ride's on me."

Here comes Suzy Snowflake;
Look at her tumblin' down,
Bringing joy to ev'ry girl and boy;
Suzy's come to town.

 I Want a Hippopotamus For Christmas
-- writing credits go to John Rox, copyright 1950. It's included on a
tape by "Joanie Bartel's Christmas Magic."

"I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
I don't want a doll, no dinkey tinker toys
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do you?
He won't have to use a dirty chimney flue
Just bring him through the front door
That's the easy thing to do

I can see me now on Christmas morning
Creeping down the stairs
Oh what joy, what surprise
When I open up my eyes
To see a hippo hero standing there

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
No crocodiles, no rhinosaurus
I only likes hippopotamuses [sic]
And hippopotamuses [sic] like me, too

Mom says a hippo would eat me up, but then
Teacher says a hippo is a vegetarian
There's lots of room for him in our two-car garage
I'd feed him there and wash him there and give him his massage."



O Come, O Come, Emmanuel

O come, O come, Emmanuel,
And ransom captive Israel,
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear.
Rejoice, rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel.

O come, O come, Thou Lord of Might,
Who to Thy tribes, on Sinai's height,
In ancient times didst give the law,
In cloud, and majesty, and awe. Refrain

O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free
Thine own from Satan's tyranny;
From depths of hell Thy people save
And give them victory o'er the grave. Refrain

O come, Thou Dayspring, come and cheer
Our spirits by Thine advent here;
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night,
And death's dark shadows put to flight. Refrain

O come, Thou Key of David, come,
And open wide our heavenly home;
Make safe the way that leads on high,
And close the path to misery. Refrain

O come, Thou Wisdom from on high,
And order all things, far and nigh;
To us the path of knowledge show,
And cause us in her ways to go. Refrain

O come, Desire of nations, bind
In one the hearts of all mankind;
Bid Thou our sad divisions cease,
And be Thyself our King of peace. Refrain


I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day

I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play.
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of Peace on earth, good will to men.

I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had roll'd along th' unbroken song
Of Peace on earth, good will to men.

And in despair, I bow'd my head:
"There is no peace on earth," I said,
"For hate is strong and mocks the song,
Of Peace on earth, good will to men."

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep;
"God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail,
With Peace on earth, good will to men."


Do You Hear What I Hear?

Said the night wind to the little lamb,
"Do you see what I see?
Way up in the sky, little lamb,
Do you see what I see?
A star, a star, dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite,
With a tail as big as a kite."

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy,
"Do you hear what I hear?
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy,
Do you hear what I hear?
A song, a song high above the trees
With a voice as big as the the sea,
With a voice as big as the the sea."

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,
"Do you know what I know?
In your palace warm, mighty king,
Do you know what I know?
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold--
Let us bring him silver and gold,
Let us bring him silver and gold."

Said the king to the people everywhere,
"Listen to what I say!
Pray for peace, people, everywhere,
Listen to what I say!
The Child, the Child sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light,
He will bring us goodness and light."


The Holly And The Ivy

The holly and the ivy,
When they are both full grown,
Of all trees that are in the wood,
The holly bears the crown:
O, the rising of the sun,
And the running of the deer
The playing of the merry organ,
Sweet singing in the choir.

The holly bears a blossom,
As white as lily flow'r,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
To be our dear Saviour: Refrain

The holly bears a berry,
As red as any blood,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
To do poor sinners good: Refrain

The holly bears a prickle,
As sharp as any thorn,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
On Christmas Day in the morn: Refrain

The holly bears a bark,
As bitter as the gall,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
For to redeem us all: Refrain

The holly and the ivy,
When they are both full grown,
Of all trees that are in the wood,
The holly bears the crown: Refrain


Here We Come A-Wassailing

Here we come a-wassailing among the leaves so green;
Here we come a-wandering, so fair to be seen.
Love and joy come to you, and to you our wassail, too.
And God bless you and send you a Happy New Year
And God bless you and send you a Happy New Year

We are not daily beggars that beg from door to door;
But we are neighbours' children whom you have seen before. Refrain

We have a little purse made of ratching leather skin;
We want a little sixpence to line it well within. Refrain

God bless the master of this house, likewise the mistress, too;
And all the little children that round the table go. Refrain


Gloucestershire Wassail

Wassail, wassail all over the town!
Our bread it is white and our ale it is brown,
Our bowl, it is made of the good maple tree;
From the wassailing bowl we'll drink unto thee.

Come, butler, and fill us a bowl of your best,
And we hope your soul in Heaven may rest;
But if you do bring us a bowl of the small,
Then down shall go butler and bowl and all.

Come here, sweet maid, in the frilly white smock,
Come trip to the door and trip back the lock!
Come trip to the door and pull back the pin,
And let us jolly wassailers in.

We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.


Caroling, Caroling
Wihla Hutson

Caroling, caroling, now we go
Christmas bells are ringing
Caroling, caroling thru the snow
Christmas bells are ringing

Joyous voices sweet and clear
Sing the sad of heart to cheer
Ding dong, ding dong
Christmas bells are ringing

Caroling, caroling thru the town
Christmas bells are ringing
Caroling, caroling up and down
Christmas bells are ringing
Mark ye well the song we sing
Gladsome tidings now we bring
Ding dong, ding dong
Christmas bells are ringing!

Caroling, caroling, near and far
Christmas bells are ringing
Following, following yonder star
Christmas bells are ringing
Sing we all this happy morn
"Lo, the King of heav'n is born!"
Ding dong, ding dong
Christmas bells are ringing


Silver Bells
Jay Livingston and Ray Evans

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air
There's a feeling
of Christmas
Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on ev'ry street corner you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing
Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush
home with their treasures

Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle
You'll hear
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing
Soon it will be Christmas day


The Christmas Song
Lyrics by Mel Torme

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some
Mistletoe help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies
On his sleigh
And ev'ry mother's
Child is gonna spy to see if
Reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this
Simple phrase to kids from
One to ninety-two
Altho' it's been said many times
Many ways; "Merry Christmas to you"


Up on the Housetop
B.R. Hanby

Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down thru the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones
Christmas joys

Chorus
Ho, ho, ho!
Who wouldn't go!
Ho, ho, ho!
Who wouldn't go!
Up on the housetop
Click, click, click
Down thru the chimney with
Good Saint Nick

First comes the stocking
Of little Nell
Oh, dear Santa
Fill it well
Give her a dolly
That laughs and cries
One that will open
And shut her eyes

Repeat Chorus

Next comes the stocking
Of little Will
Oh, just see what
A glorious fill
Here is a hammer
And lots of tacks
Also a ball
And a whip that cracks

Repeat Chorus

Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer
Irish Rovers

Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas eve.
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

She'd been drinkin' too much egg nog,
And we'd begged her not to go.
But she'd left her medication,
So she stumbled out the door into the snow.

When they found her Christmas mornin',
At the scene of the attack.
There were hoof prints on her forehead,
And incriminatin' Claus marks on her back.

Grandma got run over by a reindeer,
Walkin' home from our house Christmas eve.
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

Now were all so proud of Grandpa,
He's been takin' this so well.
See him in there watchin' football,
Drinkin' beer and playin' cards with cousin Belle.

It's not Christmas without Grandma.
All the family's dressed in black.
And we just can't help but wonder:
Should we open up her gifts or send them back?

Grandma got run over by a reindeer,
Walkin' home from our house Christmas eve.
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig.
And a blue and silver candle,
That would just have matched the hair in Grandma's wig.

I've warned all my friends and neighbours.
Better watch out for yourselves."
They should never give a license,
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves.

Grandma got run over by a reindeer,
Walkin' home from our house, Christmas eve.
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.


I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus

I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night.
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep;
She thought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep.
Then, I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white;
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night.


Over the River and Through the Woods

Over the river and through the woods
To Grandmother's house we go.
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
Through white and drifted snow.

Over the river and through the woods,
Oh, how the wind does blow.
It stings the toes and bites the nose
As over the ground we go.

Over the river and through the woods
To have a full day of play.
Oh, hear the bells ringing ting-a-ling-ling,
For it is Christmas Day.

Over the river and through the woods,
Trot fast my dapple gray;
Spring o'er the ground just like a hound,
For this is Christmas Day.

Over the river and through the woods
And straight through the barnyard gate.
It seems that we go so dreadfully slow;
It is so hard to wait.

Over the river and through the woods,
Now Grandma's cap I spy.
Hurrah for fun; the pudding's done;
Hurrah for the pumpkin pie.


A Visit from St.Nicholas
by Clement C. Moore

Down the chimney St.Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in furs from his head to his foot,
and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a pedlar just opening his pack.
His eyes how they twinkled! His dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook, when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.
He was chubby and plump - a right jolly old elf -
And laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.


It's Beginning to Look Like Christmas

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Ev'rywhere you go;
Take a look in the five-and-ten, glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
Toys in ev'ry store,
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door.

A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Ev'rywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart.

 


Ding Dong Merrily on High

Ding Dong! merrily on high
In heav'n the bells are ringing
Ding, dong! verily the sky
Is riv'n with angel singing
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis

E'en so here below, below
Let steeple bells be swungen
And i-o, i-o, i-o
By priest and people be sungen
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis

Pray ye dutifully prime
Your matin chime, ye ringers
May ye beautifully rime
Your evetime song, ye singers
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis


Frosty the Snow Man

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
and two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children
know how he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that
old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
he began to dance around
O Frosty the snowman
was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh
and play just the same as you and me
Thumpetty thump thump
thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpetty thump thump
thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Frosty the snowman knew
the sun was hot that day
So he said
"Let's run and
we'll have some fun
now before I melt away
" Down to the village
with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all
around the square saying
Catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
he heard him holler "Stop!"
For Frosty the snow man
had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying
"Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day
" Thumpetty thump thump
thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpetty thump thump
thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow


White Christmas
Irving Berlin 1942

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white


Mr. Grinch

You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel,
You're as cuddly as a cactus, you're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch,
You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel!

You're a monster, Mr. Grinch,
Your heart's an empty hole,
Your brain is full of spiders, you have garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch,
I wouldn't touch you with a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole!

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch,
You have termites in your smile,
You have all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch,
Given a choice between the two of you I'd take the seasick crocodile!

You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch,
You're the king of sinful sots,
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched with moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch,
You're a three decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich with arsenic sauce!

You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch,
With a nauseous super "naus"!,
You're a crooked dirty jockey and you drive a crooked hoss, Mr. Grinch,
Your soul is an appalling dump heap overflowing with the most disgraceful
assortment of rubbish imaginable mangled up in tangled up knots!

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch,
You're a nasty wasty skunk,
Your heart is full of unwashed socks, your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch,
The three words that best describe you are as follows, and I quote,
"Stink, stank, stunk"!

Gentle Mary Laid Her Child
[Joseph S. Cook, 1919]

Gentle Mary laid her Child
Lowly in a manger.
There He lay, the Undefiled,
To the world a stranger.
Such a Babe in such a place,
Can He be the Savior?
Ask the saved of all the race
Who have found His favor.

Angels sang about His birth,
Wise men sought and found Him.
Heaven's star shone brightly forth
Glory all around Him.
Shepherds saw the wondrous sight,
Hear the angels singing.
All the plains were lit that night,
All the hills were ringing.

Gentle Mary laid her Child
Lowly in a manger.
He is still the Undefiled,
But no more a stranger.
Son of God of humble birth,
Beautiful the story.
Praise His name in all the earth.
Hail! The King of Glory!


Go Tell It On The Mountain

When I was a seeker
I sought both night and day,
I asked the Lord to help me,
And he showed me the way.

Chorus
Go tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere,
Go tell it on the mountain,
Our Jesus Christ is born.

He made me a watchman
Upon a city wall,
And if I am a Christian,
I am the least of all.

Chorus
Go tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere,
Go tell it on the mountain,
Our Jesus Christ is born.


Jingle Bells
James Pierpont - 1857

Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight

Chorus
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot
(Chorus)

A day or two ago, the story I must tell
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away
(Chorus)

Now the ground is white, go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead
(Chorus)


Jolly Old Saint Nicholas

Jolly old Saint Nicholas,
Lean your ear this way!
Don't you tell a single soul
What I'm going to say;
Christmas Eve is coming soon;
Now, you dear old man,
Whisper what you'll bring to me;
Tell me if you can.

When the clock is striking twelve,
When I'm fast asleep,
Down the chimney broad and black,
With your pack you'll creep;
All the stockings you will find
Hanging in a row;
Mine will be the shortest one,
You'll be sure to know.

Johnny wants a pair of skates;
Susy wants a dolly;
Nellie wants a story book;
She thinks dolls are folly;
As for me, my little brain
Isn't very bright;
Choose for me, old Santa Claus,
What you think is right.


We Three Kings of Orient Are
[John H. Hopkins, Jr., 1857]

We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar.
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
Following yonder star.

Chorus
O star of wonder, star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect Light.

Born a king on Bethlehem's plain,
Gold I bring to crown Him again,
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign.
(Chorus)

Frankincense to offer have I.
Incense owns a Deity nigh.
Prayer and praising all men raising,
Worship Him, God on high.
(Chorus)

Myrrh is mine: Its bitter perfume
Breaths a life of gathering gloom.
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding dying,
Sealed in the stone-cold tomb.
(Chorus)

Glorious now behold Him arise,
King and God and Sacrifice.
Alleluia, alleluia!
Sounds through the earth and skies.
(Chorus)


All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth

Every body stops
and stares at me
These two teeth are
gone as you can see
I don't know just who
to blame for this catastrophe!
But my one wish on Christmas Eve
is as plain as it can be!

All I want for Christmas
is my two front teeth,
my two front teeth,
see my two front teeth!
Gee, if I could only
have my two front teeth,
then I could with you
"Merry Christmas."
It seems so long since I could say,
"Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!"

Gosh oh gee, how happy I'd be,
if I could only whistle (thhhh)
All I want for Christmas
is my two front teeth,
my two front teeth,
see my two front teeth.
Gee, if I could only
have my two front teeth,
then I could wish you
"Merry Christmas!"


Blue Christmas
B.Hayes, J.Johnson (c) 1948

I'll have a blue Christmas without you;
I'll be so blue thinking about you.
Decorations of red
on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if
you're not here with me.

I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain;
And when that blue heartache starts hurting,
You'll be doing all right
with your Christmas of white,
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.

Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas
from the film Meet Me In St. Louis
Hugh Martin, Ralph Blane 1943

Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Let your heart be light
From now on,
our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Make the Yule-tide gay,
From now on,
our troubles will be miles away.

Here were are as in olden days,
happy golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who are dear to us
gather near to us once more.

Through the years we all will be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now.


Here Comes Santa Claus
Gene Autry, Oakley Haldeman (c) 1947

Here comes Santa Claus!
Here comes Santa Claus!
Right down Santa Claus Lane!
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
are pulling on the reins.
Bells are ringing, children singing;
All is merry and bright.
Hang your stockings and say your prayers,
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.

Here comes Santa Claus!
Here comes Santa Claus!
Right down Santa Claus Lane!
He's got a bag that is filled with toys
for the boys and girls again.
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle,
What a beautiful sight.
Jump in bed, cover up your head,
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.


Holly Jolly Christmas
Johnny Marks (c) 1972

Have a holly, jolly Christmas;
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow,
but have a cup of cheer.
Have a holly, jolly Christmas;
And when you walk down the street
Say Hello to friends you know
and everyone you meet.

Oh, ho, the mistletoe
hung where you can see;
Somebody waits for you;
Kiss her once for me.
Have a holly jolly Christmas,
and in case you didn't hear,
Oh by golly, have a holly,
jolly Christmas this year.


I'll Be Home for Christmas
Kim Gannon, Walter Kent (c) 1943

I'll be home for Christmas;
You can count on me.
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree.
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love-light gleams.
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams.


Jingle Bell Rock
Bobby Helms

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun.

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air.

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell rock.


Let It Snow!
Sammy Cahn, Jule Styne (c) 1945

Oh, the weather outside is frightful,
But the fire is so delightful,
And since we've no place to go,
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

It doesn't show signs of stopping,
And I brought some corn for popping;
The lights are turned way down low,
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

When we finally say good night,
How I'll hate going out in the storm;
But if you really hold me tight,
All the way home I'll be warm.

The fire is slowly dying,
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing,
But as long as you love me so.
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.


Rocking Around the Christmas Tree
Brenda Lee

Rocking around the Christmas tree
at the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
every couple tries to stop
Rocking around the Christmas tree,
let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
and we'll do some caroling.

You will get a sentimental
feeling when you hear
Voices singing let's be jolly,
deck the halls with boughs of holly
Rocking around the Christmas tree,
have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
in the new old-fashioned way.


Sleigh Ride
Mitchell Parish, Leroy Anderson 1948

Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing
Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling "You Hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap let's go
Let's look at the snow
We're riding in a wonderland of snow

Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with the song
Of a wintry fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two
Birds of a feather would be

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop! Pop! Pop!

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives


The Wassail Song

Here we come a-wassailing
Among the leaves so green,
Here we come a wand'ring,
So fair to be seen.

Chorus
Love and joy come to you,
And to your wassail too,
And God bless you and send you a happy new year,
And God send you a happy new year.

We are not daily beggars
Who beg from door to door,
But we are neighbor's children
Whom you have seen before.

Chorus
Love and joy come to you,
And to your wassail too,
And God bless you and send you a happy new year,
And God send you a happy new year.

We have a little purse
Made of ratching leather skin;
We want some of your small change
To line it well within.

Chorus
Love and joy come to you,
And to your wassail too,
And God bless you and send you a happy new year,
And God send you a happy new year.

God bless the Master of this house,
Likewise the Mistress too;
And all the little children
That round the table go.

Chorus
Love and joy come to you,
And to your wassail too,
And God bless you and send you a happy new year,
And God send you a happy new year.


Winter Wonderland
Dick Smith, Felix Bernard 1934

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
in the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
we're happy tonight,
walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
as we go along,
walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
we'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
when you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
as we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
the plans that we've made,
walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
and pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
until the other kiddies knock him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
walking in a winter wonderland.

Walking in a winter wonderland,
walking in a winter wonderland.


Winter Wonderland (Or the un-traditional one for)

Lacy things -- the wife is missin',
Didn't ask -- her permission,
I'm wearin' her clothes,
Her silk pantyhose,
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear.

In the store -- there's a teddy,
Little straps -- like spaghetti,
It holds me so tight,
Like handcuffs at night,
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear.

In the office there's a guy named Melvin, He pretends that I am Murphy Brown.
He'll say, "Are you ready?" I'll say,"Whoa, Man!" "Let's wait until our wives are out of town!"

Later on, if you wanna,
We can dress -- like Madonna,
Put on some eyeshade,
And join the parade,
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear!

Lacy things... missin',
Didn't ask... permission,
Wearin' her clothes,
Her silk pantyhose,
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear,
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear,
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear!


The Holly and the Ivy

The holly and the ivy,
When they are both full grown,
Of all the trees that are in the wood,
The holly bears the crown.

O the rising of the sun,
And the running of the deer,
The playing of the merry organ,
Sweet singing in the choir.

The holly bears a blossom
As white as lily flower;
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
To be our sweet Savior.

The holly bears a berry
As red as any blood;
Any Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
To do poor sinners good.

The holly bears a prickle
As sharp as any thorn;
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
On Christmas day in the morn.

The holly bears a bark
As bitter as any gall;
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
For to redeem us all.

The holly and the ivy,
When they are both full grown,
Of all the trees that are in the wood,
The holly bears the crown.


Let There be Peace on Earth

Let there be peace on earth
and let it begin with me
Let There Be Peace on Earth
The peace that was meant to be

With God as our Father
Brothers all are we
Let me walk with my brother
In perfect harmony.

Let peace begin with me
Let this be the moment now.

With ev'ry step I take
Let this be my solemn vow;
To take each moment and live
Each moment in peace eternally
Let there be peace on earth
and let it begin with me


While Shepherds Watch Their Flocks

While Shepherds watch their flocks by night
All seated on the ground
The angel of the Lord came down
And glory shone arond
"Fear not," said he for mighty dread
had seized their troubled mind
"Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all man-kind"

"To you in David's town this day
Is born of David's line
The Savior who is Christ the Lord
And this shall me the sign
The heav'n'ly babe you there shall find
To human view displayed
All meanly wrapped in swathing bands
And in a manger laid"

Thus spoke the seraph and forth-with
Appeared a shiny throng
Of angels praising God who thus
Addressed their joyful song
"All glory be to God on high
And on the earth be peace
Goodwill hence-forth from heav'n to men
Begin and never cease"


I HEARD THE BELLS ON CHRISTMAS DAY

    (Henry Wadsworth Longfellow)
I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men.
     
I thought how, as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along th' unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.
     
And in despair I bowed my head
"There is no peace on earth," I said,
"For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men."
     
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
"God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth, good will to men."
     
Till ringing, singing on its way
The world revolved from night to day,
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good will to men.


Nuttin' For Christmas

S. Tepper, R. Bennett (c) 1955

I broke my bat on Johnny's head;
Somebody snitched on me.
I hid a frog in sister's bed;
Somebody snitched on me.
I spilled some ink on Mommy's rug;
I made Tommy eat a bug;
Bought some gum with a penny slug;
Somebody snitched on me.

Oh, I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas
Mommy and Daddy are mad.
I'm getting nuttin' for Christmas
'Cause I ain't been nuttin' but bad.

I put a tack on teacher's chair
somebody snitched on me.
I tied a knot in Susie's hair
somebody snitched on me.
I did a dance on Mommy's plants
climbed a tree and tore my pants
Filled the sugar bowl with ants
somebody snitched on me.

So, I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas
Mommy and Daddy are mad.
I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas
'Cause I ain't been nuttin' but bad.

I won't be seeing Santa Claus;
Somebody snitched on me.
He won't come visit me because
Somebody snitched on me.
Next year I'll be going straight;
Next year I'll be good, just wait
I'd start now, but it's too late;
Somebody snitched on me.

So you better be good whatever you do
'Cause if you're bad, I'm warning you,
You'll get nuttin' for Christmas.


Pine Cones And Holly Berries

Pine cones and Holly Berries
Popcorn for you, apples for me
Red striped candy, nut cracker handy
Kettle a-bubbleing hot as can be.
snow clouds hang low and threatening
Maybe in won't, praying it may
the brightest fireplace glows in every face
Waiting for Christmas day.

There'll be walk-a-round songs and
talk-a-round songs
Songs of the inn and stable.
There'll be morning time songs and
evening time songs
And grace at every table.
And Jingle bells will jingle all the way all day.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel,
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart.


Sleep Well, Little Children

A.Bergman, L.Klatzkin (c) 1956

Sleep well, little children,
wherever you are;
Tomorrow is Christmas
beneath every star.
Soon the snowflakes will fall
and tomorrow you'll see
Every wish, one and all,
waiting under the tree.

Sleep well, little children,
pleasant dreams through the night;
Tomorrow is Christmas,
all merry and bright.
Soon you'll hear the bells ring,
time for dreams to come true
As the world wakes to bring
Merry Christmas to you.


A Baby Just Like You

John Denver, J. Henry (c) 1975

The season is upon us now
A time for gifts and giving
And as the year draws to its close
I think about my living

The Christmas time when I was young,
The magic and the wonder,
But colors dull and candles dim,
And dark my standing under

O little Zachary, shining light
You've set my soul to dreaming
You've given back my joy in life
And filled me with new meaning

A Savior King was born that day,
A baby just like you,
And as the Magi came with gifts,
I come with my gift too

That peace on Earth fills up your time,
That brotherhood surrounds you.
That you may know the warmth of love,
And wrap it all around you

It's just a wish, a dream I'm told
From days when I was young
Merry Christmas, little Zachary
Merry Christmas, everyone
Merry Christmas, little Zachary
Merry Christmas, everyone


Christmas Dinner

Paul Stookey, 1963

And it came to pass on a Christmas evening
While all the doors were shuttered tight
Outside standing, lonely boy-child
Cold and shivering in the night

On the street, every window
Save but one, was gleaming bright
And to this window walked the boy-child
Peeking in saw, candle light

Through other windows he had looked at turkeys
Ducks and geese, cherry pies
But through this window saw a grey-haired lady
Table bare and tears in her eyes

Into his coat reached the boy-child
Knowing well there was little there
He took from his pocket,
his own Christmas dinner
A bit of cheese, some bread to share

His outstretched hands
held the food and they trembled
As the door, it opened wide
Said he, Would you share with me Christmas dinner
Gently said she, Come inside

The grey-haired lady brought forth to the table
Glasses two and her last drop of wine
Said she, Here's a toast to everyone's Christmas
and especially, yours and mine

And it came to pass on that Christmas evening
While all the doors were shuttered tight
That in that town, the happiest Christmas
Was shared by candle light


Christmas For Cowboys

S. Weisberg (c) 1975

Tall in the saddle we spend Christmas day
Driving the cattle on the snow-covered plains.
All of the good gifts given today;
Ours is the sky and the wide open range.

Back in the cities, they have different ways,
Football and eggnog and Christmas parades.
I'll take the blanket; I'll take the reins;
Christmas for Cowboys and wide open plains.

A campfire for warmth as we stop for the night;
The stars overhead are the Christmas-tree lights.
The wind sings a hymn as we bow down to pray;
Christmas for Cowboys and the wide open plains.

It's tall in the saddle we spend Christmas Day,
Driving the cattle on the snow-covered plains.
So many gifts have been opened today;
Ours is the sky and the wide open range.
It's Christmas for Cowboys and wide open plains.


Christmas In Killarney

The holly green, the ivy green
The prettiest picture you've ever seen
Is Christmas in Killarney
With all of the folks at home

It's nice, you know, to kiss your beau
While cuddling under the mistletoe
And Santa Claus you know, of course
Is one of the boys from home

The door is always open
The neighbors pay a call
And Father John before he's gone
Will bless the house and all

How grand it feels to click your heels
And join in the fun of the jigs and reels
I'm handing you no blarney
The likes you've never known
Is Christmas in Killarney
With all of the folks at home


It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year

Eddie Pola, George Wyle 1963

It's the most wonderful time of the year.
With the kids jingle belling,
and everyone telling you,
"Be of good cheer,"
It's the most wonderful time of the year.

There'll be parties for hosting,
marshmallows for toasting and
caroling out in the snow.
there'll be scary ghost stories and
tales of the glories of Christmases
long, long ago.

It's the most wonderful time of the year.
There'll be much mistletoeing
and hearts will be glowing,
when loved ones are near.
It's the most wonderful time of the year.


THIS IS THAT TIME OF THE YEAR
1967 ForTe Music, Inc. & Edwin H. Morris & Co., Inc.
(Jack Jones and Chorus)

This is that time of the year,
A tinselly, glittery time;
Long distance calls to uncle and aunt,
On ev'ry corner you bump into Santa,
'Cause this is that time of the year,
A holly and jolly old time;
Windows are dressed in ribbons of silk,
And Junior drinks all of his milk!
    Poppa . . . keeps buying presents
    And sneaks them into the closet;
    Momma . . . goes to the bank
    But she holds out a dollar from ev'ry deposit;
'Cause this is that time of the year,
A silver bow, mistletoe time;
Spirits are high, good will and good cheer,
We're putting the tree up,
The kids shouldn't be up,
Saint Nick says, "Giddeyup!"
To Dasher, Dancer, Blitzen, Prancer;
This is that time of the year!

This is that time of the year,
A tinselly, glittery time;
Dumpling and goose and pudding and pie,
(Perfect excuse to go right off your diet!)
'Cause this is that time of the year,
A holly and jolly old time;
Snow on your roof, your face and your shoes,
And presents that you'll; never use!
    Grandma . . . feels twenty-two so,
    She dons her gayest apparel;
    He stands at the spinet and sings ev'ry carol;
'Cause this is that time of the year,
A silver bow, mistletoe time;
Etc.

A baby changes everything. 
Not a ring on her hand  
All her dreams and all her plans  
A baby changes everything  
A baby changes everything.
The man she loves she's never touched  
How will she keep his trust?  
A baby changes everything 
A baby changes everything.
And she cries, oh she cries  
She has to leave, go far away  
Heaven knows she can't stay  
A baby changes everything  
A baby changes everything.
She can feel it's coming soon  
There's no place, there's no room  
A baby changes everything  
A baby changes everything.
And she cries and she cries  
O she cries  
A baby changes everything 
A baby changes everything.
Shepherds all gather 'round 
Up above, the star shines down 
A baby changes everything 
A baby changes everything.
Choir of Angels say  
Glory to the newborn king  
A baby changes everything  
A baby changes everything 
Everything, everything, every day.
Hallelujah, hallelujah 
Hallelujah, hallelujah.
My whole life is turned around  
I was lost and now I'm found  
A baby changes everything  
A baby changes everything. 



And as the year draws to its close
I think about my living.
The Christmas time when I was young
The magic and the wonder
But colors dull and candles dim
And dark my standing under.
O little Zachary, shining light
You've set my soul to dreaming
You've given back my joy in life
And filled me with new meaning.
A Savior King was born that day,
A baby just like you,
And as the Magi came with gifts
I come with my gift too.
That peace on Earth fills up your time
That brotherhood surrounds you
That you may know the warmth of love
And wrap it all around you.
It's just a wish, a dream I'm told
From days when I was young
Merry Christmas, little Zachary
Merry Christmas, everyone
Merry Christmas, little Zachary
Merry Christmas, everyone.



A Boy is Born in Bethlehem 
Allelujah! Allelujah! 
And joy is in Jerusalem 
Allelujah! Allelujah! 
And there He lay in manger poor

From East bring incense, myrrh, and gold

To hail the newborn King of Kings.

Yet earthly father hath He none
Alleluia!
And from the serpent's poison free
He owned our blood and pedigree

Our feeble flesh and His the same
Our sinless kinsman He became

That we, from deadly thrall set free
Like Him and so like God should be

Rejoice before the Lord and pray.

Give praise and thanks eternally. 
Alleluia!



A Child this day is born
A Child of high renown
Most worthy of a sceptre
A sceptre and a crown.
Chorus
Glad tidings to all men
Glad tidings sing we may
Because the King of Kings
Was born on Christmas Day.
These tidings shepherds heard
While watching over their fold
Twas by an Angel unto them
That night revealed and told.
Chorus
Glad tidings to all men
Glad tidings sing we may
Because the King of Kings
Was born on Christmas Day.
To whom the Angel spoke
Saying, "Be not afraid
Be glad, poor silly shepherds
Why are you so dismayed?"
Chorus
Glad tidings to all men
Glad tidings sing we may
Because the King of Kings
Was born on Christmas Day.
"For lo! I bring you tidings
Of gladness and of mirth
Which cometh to all people by
This holy Infant's birth".

Glad tidings sing we may
Because the King of Kings
Was born on Christmas Day.
Then was there with the Angel
An host incontinent
Of heavenly bright soldiers
All from the highest sent.

Glad tidings sing we may
Because the King of Kings
Was born on Christmas Day.
They praised the Lord, our God
And our celestial King
All glory be in Paradise
This heavenly host do sing.

Glad tidings to all men
Glad tidings sing we may
Because the King of Kings
Was born on Christmas Day.
And as the Angel told them
So to them did appear
They found the young Child Jesus Christ
With Mary his mother dear.
Chorus
Glad tidings to all men
Glad tidings sing we may
Because the King of Kings
Was born on Christmas Day.
All glory be to God
That sitteth still on high
With praises and with triumph great
And joyful melody.
Chorus
Glad tidings to all men
Glad tidings sing we may
Because the King of Kings
Was born on Christmas Day.


Strangers meet and they willingly surrender  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember.
Almost went to Aspen, but something told me no  
I considered Mammoth, but there wasn't enough snow  
And I even thought of Gatlinburg, but that seemed so far to go  
So I headed up to Tahoe for a Christmas on the slopes.
And I had fantasized about Christmas in this way  
Curled up by a fireplace in a Tahoe ski chalet  
With a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood  
But even in my wildest dreams it never got this good.
You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin' in the middle of December  
Change the radio and I'll turn the lights down dimmer  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember.
Strangers when we met, lovers as we leave  
Christmas to remember, too good to believe  
Don't know how or when, but I know we'll meet again  
We'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind.
And you've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin' in the middle of December  
'Neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember.
We loved and laughed and played and joked  
Sang Christmas songs and talked to folks  
Sleighed the fields and skied the slopes  
Then to the lodge for dinner. 
But now it's time for us to go  
As our hearts melt like chimney snow  
There's just one thing I want to know  
Can we do this next winter?  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember.
You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin' in the middle of December  
Though the fire is hot, we'll just have to let it simmer  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember.
You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin' in the middle of December  
Though it's cold outside we'll just stroke the burning embers  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember.

A day, a day of glory 
A day that ends our woe 
A day that tells of triumph 
Against our vanquished foe 
Yield, summer's brightest sunrise 
To this December morn 
Lift up your gates, ye princes 
And let the Child be born 
With Gloria in excelsis 
Archangels tell their mirth 
With Kyrie eleison 
Men answer upon earth 
And angels swell the triumph 
And mortals raise the horn 
Lift up your gates, ye princes 
And let the Child be born.
He comes, His throne the manger 
He comes, His shrine the stall 
The ox and ass His courtiers 
Who made and governs all 
The "House of Bread" His birth-place 
The Prince of wine and corn 
Lift up your gates, ye princes 
And let the Child be born.
Then bar the gates, that henceforth 
None thus may passage win 
Because the Prince of Israel 
Alone hath entered in 
The earth, the sky, the ocean 
His glorious way adorn 
Lift up your gates, ye princes 
And let the Child be born.

Outside I hear the voices sing, the sweetest sounds of caroling 
But somehow there's a sadness in the song 
In our hearts we know that some thing's wrong.
Chorus
It's a different kind of Christmas
In a different kind of world
Even though it looks the same
Everything has changed
It's a different kind of Christmas.
Children opening gifts with wonder and surprise
I wish that I could still see through such innocent eyes
I used to feel so safe inside, I had a place to run and hide
In my daddy's arms I felt secure 
No one can protect us anymore.
Chorus
It's a different kind of Christmas
In a different kind of world
Even though it looks the same
Everything has changed
It's a different kind of Christmas.
Sending cards that talk of peace and love and cheer
Oh that's what we need if we'd only believe
It would be.
Chorus
It's a different kind of Christmas
In a different kind of world
Even though it looks the same
Everything has changed 
It's a different kind of Christmas.

See the people as they rush all around 
Every store in the town 
Selling toys to go under the tree 
Every corner has a red-suited man 
With a bell in his hand, 
And the sights are something to see.
But beneath all the noise, 
They can find the true meaning of Christmas 
Jesus came to the earth, a gift from heaven above 
Far beyond all the toys 
They can find the true meaning of Christmas 
Jesus came to the earth, with forgiveness and love 
As a gift for all!
See the families as they all gather near, 
Full of holiday cheer 
As the lights flash bright red and green 
Turkey, dressing, and some fresh apple pie 
Put a gleam in your eye 
It's more fun than you've ever seen.
But beneath all the noise, 
We can find the true meaning of Christmas 
Jesus came to the earth, a gift from heaven above 
Far beyond all the toys 
We can find the true meaning of Christmas 
Jesus came to the earth, with forgiveness and love 
As a gift for all!
Come, let me tell you of the One 
From heaven above 
Came as a humble child to Bethlehem 
Thanks be unto Him 
Tell of the One 
From heaven above 
Came to show Truth and Love in every way 
Turn our darkness into Day
That's what Christmas truly means to me!


A great and mighty wonder 
A full and holy cure 
The Virgin bears the Infant 
With virgin honor pure.
To God on high be glory 
And peace on earth to men!
The Word becomes incarnate 
And yet remains on high 
And cherubim sing anthems 
To shepherds from the sky.
To God on high be glory 
And peace on earth to men!
While thus they sing your Monarch 
Those bright angelic bands 
Rejoice, ye vales and mountains 
Ye oceans, clap your hands.
To God on high be glory 
And peace on earth to men!
Since all He comes to ransom 
By all be He adored 
The Infant born in Bethlehem 
The Savior and the Lord.
To God on high be glory 
And peace on earth to men!
And idol forms shall perish 
And error shall decay 
And Christ shall wield His scepter 
Our Lord and God for aye.
To God on high be glory 
And peace on earth to men!

The robots awake 
To find that they've been taped down  
Wondering when 
They'll break through these chains 
But, little boys have action toys for brains 
I'm living proof it can last a long time.

Now, the girls off the street are innocent and sweet 
When they're all in bed 
They got their make-up and dreams of wonderland 
Sprinkled inside their heads 
And soon they will change 
But tonight 
Hollywood has never seemed so strange 
Now, mothers pray it'll last a long time.

I want to roll around  
Like a kid in the snow 
I want to re-learn what I already know 
Just let me take pride 
Just to rev through the night 
On a great big sled.
I want to wish you Merry Christmas 
Ho Ho Ho.
Now, the boys are all grown up 
And their working their fingers to the bone 
They go around chasing them girls on the weekend 
You know they still can't be alone 
I've been racking my brain 
With thoughts of peace and love 
How on earth did we get so mixed up? 
I pray to God it don't last a long time.
I want to roll around  
Like a kid in the snow 
I want to re-learn what I already know 
Just let me take pride 
Just to rev through the night 
On a great big sled.
I hear the sound of bells 
There's something on the roof 
I wonder what this night will bring.
I want to roll around like a kid in the snow 
(I hear the sound of bells) 
I want to re-learn what I already know 
(There's something on the roof) 
Just let me take pride 
(I wonder what this night will bring)
Just to rev through the night 
On a great big sled. 
I want to wish you Merry Christmas 
(Can't do that) 
I want to wish you Merry Christmas 
(Can't do that).

Honey, it's cold outside 
Pour another glass of wine 
Light up the fireplace 
The holiday starts right now 
Make yourself slow down 
Put on a happy face.
I don't want you to buy me nothin' 
It's alright 
Love's the only thing on my list 
All I want is a kiss for Christmas 
Honey, won't you give me a kiss for Christmas?  
Darlin'. 
Early on Christmas day 
Everyone looks for love  
Under the Christmas tree 
And though you might think it's strange 
I wanna tell you, my love 
Don't buy a thing for me.
I don't want you to get me nothin' 
It's alright 
'Cause if I could just get my wish 
All I want is a kiss for Christmas 
Honey, won't you give me a kiss for Christmas?  
Darlin'. 
A kiss for Christmas is all that I want  
Yeah 
A kiss for Christmas 
Don't make me wait for love 
This Christmas all that I want is 
A kiss for Christmas 
Don't make me wait, love. 
Don't make me wait, baby 
Merry Christmas 
Yeah 
Come on 
Yeah  
Don't think about it, don't think about it. 
All I want is a kiss for Christmas 
Honey, won't you give me a kiss for Christmas?  
Darlin' 
All I want is a kiss for Christmas. 
Honey, won't you give me a kiss for Christmas?  
Darlin' 
All I want is a kiss for Christmas 
Honey, won't you give me a kiss for Christmas?

The Mighty God was still His Name 
And angels worshiped as He lay 
The seeming Infant of a day.
He Who, a little Child, began  
The life divine to show to man 
Proclaims from Heav'n the message free 
"Let little children come to Me." 
We bring them, Lord, and with the sign  
Of sprinkled water name them Thine 
Their souls with saving grace endow 
Baptize them with Thy Spirit now. 
O give Thine angels charge, good Lord 
Them safely in Thy way to guard 
Thy blessing on their lives command 
And write their names upon Thy hand.
O Thou, who by an infant's tongue 
Dost hear Thy perfect glory sung 
May these, with all the heav'nly host 
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

It's a marshmallow world in the winter, 
When the snow comes to cover the ground,
It's the time for play, it's a whipped-cream day,
I wait for it the whole year round.
These marshmallow clouds being friendly,
In the arms of the evergreen trees,
And the sun is red like a pumpkin head,
It's shining, so your nose won't freeze. 
The world is your snowball, see how it grows,
That's how it goes, whenever it snows,
The world is your snowball just for a song,
Get out and roll it along. 
It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts,
Take a walk with your favorite girl
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late,
In winter, it's a marshmallow world
In winter, it's a marshmallow world.
In winter, it's a marshmallow world.

In a party or dinner for two 
Anywhere would do 
Celebrating the yuletide season 
Always lights up our lives 
Simple pleasures are made special too 
When they're shared with you. 
Looking through some old photographs 
Faces and friends we'll always remember 
Watching busy shoppers rushing about 
In the cool breeze of December 
Sparkling lights all over town 
Children's carols in the air 
By the Christmas tree 
A shower of stardust on your hair. 
I can't think of a better Christmas 
Than my wish coming true 
And my wish is that you'd let me spend  
My whole life with you. 
Looking through some old photographs

I can't think of a better Christmas 
Than my wish coming true 
And my wish is that you'd let me spend

My idea of a perfect Christmas  
Is spending it with you.



I had come down the chimney with presents to give 
And to see just who in this home did live.
I looked all about, a strange sight I did see 
No tinsel, no presents, not even a tree 
No stocking by the mantle, just boots filled with sand 
On the wall hung pictures of far distant lands.
With medals and badges, awards of all kinds 
A sober thought came through my mind 
For this house was different, it was dark and dreary 
I found the home of a soldier, once I could see clearly.
The soldier lay sleeping, silent, alone 
Curled up on the floor in this one bedroom home 
The face was so gentle, the room in such disorder 
Not how I pictured a United States soldier.
Was this the hero of whom I'd just read? 
Curled up on a poncho, the floor for a bed? 
I realized the families that I saw this night 
Owed their lives to these soldiers who were willing to fight.
Soon round the world, the children would play 
And grownups would celebrate a bright Christmas day 
They all enjoyed freedom each month of the year 
Because of the soldiers, like the one lying here.
I couldn't help wonder how many lay alone 
On a cold Christmas Eve in a land far from home 
The very thought brought a tear to my eye 
I dropped to my knees and started to cry.
The soldier awakened and I heard a rough voice 
"Santa don't cry, this life is my choice; 
I fight for freedom, I don't ask for more 
My life is my God, my country, My Corps".
The soldier rolled over and drifted to sleep 
I couldn't control it, I continued to weep 
I kept watch for hours, so silent and still 
And we both shivered from the cold night's chill.
I didn't want to leave on that cold, dark night 
This guardian of honor so willing to fight 
The soldier rolled over, with a voice soft and pure 
Whispered, "Carry on Santa, it's Christmas day, all is secure".
One look at my watch and I knew he was right 
Merry Christmas my friend, and to all a good night.

Hang your favorite dream on a star  
Wish upon it Christmas night  
Sing about the better things 
The friends we have, the joy they bring  
Hang a dream upon a star and wish it Christmas night  
Peace on earth we dream for the world  
Time to love and time to share  
We can wish for love in the world  
Time to give and time to care. 
On this day is born the child Jesus, Prince of Peace   
Hear Him whisper in your heart   
Let all hatred cease   
His star will brighten the darkest night   
To light your way if you believe   
The love you seek will be in your heart  
Ask and you'll receive   
On this day will rise the morning sun   
All the bells will ring   
(ding dong ding dong) 
Hope is born for peace throughout our land   
Let Earth and heaven sing. 
Sing a song and light up the lights 
We need to make this Christmas bright  
Hang your favorite dream on a star  
Wish upon it Christmas night  
Sing about the better things 
The friends we have, the joy they bring  
Hang a dream upon a star and wish it Christmas night  
Peace on earth we dream for the world  
Time to love and time to share  
We can wish for love in the world  
Time to give and time to care 
Sing about the better things 
The friends we have the happiness they bring  
Sing a song of dreams come true and bless the new year, too.
Lalalala... 

Adam lay ybounden 
Bounden in a bond; 
Four thousand winter, 
Thought he not too long.
And all was for an apple 
An apple that he took. 
As clerkes finden, 
Written in their book.
Ne had the apple taken been 
The apple taken been, 
Ne had never our ladie, 
Abeen heav'ne queen.
Blessed be the time 
That apple taken was, 
Therefore we moun singen. 
Deo gracias!

Venite, venite in Bethlehem
Natum videte, regem angelorum
Venite adoremus, venite adoremus
Venite adoremus, dominum.
Cantet nunc io, chorus angelorum
Cantet nunc aula caelestium
Gloria, gloria in excelsis Deo
Venite adoremus, venite adoremus
Venite adoremus, dominum.
Ergo qui natus, die hodierna
Jesu, tibi sit gloria
Patris aeterni, verbum caro factus
Venite adoremus, venite adoremus
Venite adoremus, dominum.
English
Oh come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant,
Oh come ye, Oh come ye to Bethlehem   
Come and behold Him, born the King of Angels  
Oh come, let us adore Him 
Oh come, let us adore Him 
Oh come, let us adore Him 
Christ the Lord.
Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation
Oh Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above   
Glory to God in the highest   
Oh come, let us adore Him 
Oh come, let us adore Him 
Oh come, let us adore Him 
Christ the Lord.
Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning
Jesus, to Thee be all glory giving   
Word of the Father now in flesh appearing   
Oh come, let us adore Him 
Oh come, let us adore Him 
Oh come, let us adore Him 
Christ the Lord. 



The bells will be ringing at Saint John the Divine 
I get a little lonely every year around this time. 
The music plays all night in Little Italy 
The lights will be going up on old Rockefeller's tree 
People window shopping on Fifth Avenue 
All I want for Christmas is you. 
I've got to know 
Where do lonely hearts go? 
Because nobody ought to be  
All alone on Christmas.
Things are different since you've been here last 
Childhood dreaming is a thing of the past 
Maybe you can bring us some hope this year 
Visions of sugar plums have disappeared. 
Do you remember sleigh riding in the snow 
And dancing all night to "Baby, Please Come Home"? 
Today's celebration is bittersweet 
There's mothers and children in the street. 
I've got to know 
Where do lonely hearts go? 
Because nobody ought to be  
All alone on Christmas.
I'm all grown up, but I'm the same you'll see
I'm writing this letter 'cause I still believe
Dear Santa, I've been good this year
Can't you stay a little while with me right here? 
Tell me
I've got to know 
Where do lonely hearts go? 
Because nobody ought to be  
All alone on Christmas.
Nobody ought to be  
All alone on Christmas.

All hail to Thee, Immanuel
We cast our crowns before Thee  
Let every heart obey Thy will
And every voice adore Thee  
In praise to Thee, our Savior King
The vibrant chords of Heaven ring 
And echo back the mighty strain:
All hail! All hail! All hail Immanuel!
Hail to the King we love so well!
Immanuel! Immanuel! 
Hail to the King we love so well! 
Immanuel! Immanuel! 
Glory and honor and majesty  
Wisdom and power be unto Thee 
Now and evermore! 
Hail to the King we love so well!
Immanuel! Immanuel! 
Hail to the King we love so well! 
Immanuel! Immanuel! 
King of kings and Lord of lords 
All hail, Immanuel!
All hail to Thee, Immanuel 
The ransomed hosts surround Thee  
And earthly monarchs clamor forth 
Their sovereign King to crown Thee  
While those redeemed in ages gone
Assembled round the great white throne  
Break forth into immortal song: 
All hail! All hail! All hail Immanuel!
Hail to the King we love so well!
Immanuel! Immanuel! 
Hail to the King we love so well!
Immanuel! Immanuel! 
Glory and honor and majesty
Wisdom and power be unto Thee 
Now and evermore! 
Hail to the King we love so well! 
Immanuel! Immanuel! 
Hail to the King we love so well! 
Immanuel! Immanuel! 
King of kings and Lord of lords 
All hail, Immanuel!
All hail to Thee, Immanuel 
Our risen King and Savior  
Thy foes are vanquished 
And Thou art omnipotent forever  
Death, sin and hell no longer reign
And Satan's pow'r is burst in twain  
Eternal glory to Thy Name:
All hail! All hail! All hail Immanuel! 
Hail to the King we love so well!
Immanuel! Immanuel! 
Hail to the King we love so well!
Immanuel! Immanuel! 
Glory and honor and majesty
Wisdom and power be unto Thee 
Now and evermore! 
Hail to the King we love so well! 
Immanuel! Immanuel! 
Hail to the King we love so well! 
Immanuel! Immanuel! 
King of kings and Lord of lords 
All hail, Immanuel!

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas  
Only a hippopotamus will do  
Don't want a doll, no dinky tinker toy 
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy.
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas 
I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do you? 
He won't have to use our dirty chimney flue 
Just bring him through the front door  
That's the easy thing to do.
I can see me now on Christmas morning  
Creeping down the stairs 
Oh, what joy and what surprise 
When I open up my eyes 
To see a hippo hero standing there.
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas 
Only a hippopotamus will do 
No crocodiles, no rhinoceroses 
I only like hippopotamuses 
And hippopotamuses like me too.
Mom says the hippo would eat me up, but then 
Teacher says a hippo is a vegetarian 
There's lots of room for him in our two-car garage 
I'd feed him there and wash him there  
And give him his massage.
I can see me now on Christmas morning  
Creeping down the stairs 
Oh what joy and what surprise When I open up my eyes 
To see a hippo hero standing there.
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas 
Only a hippopotamus will do 
No crocodiles or rhinoceroses 
I only like hippopotamuses 
And hippopotamuses like me too

All I want for Christmas is a real good tan 
Take me to the islands, put my feet in the sand 
Rocking to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean 
Singin 'Silent Night' with the palm trees blowin'.
Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan? 
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan. 
Well, if you're thinkin' bout getting me a present this year 
Let me put a bug in your cute little ear 
How 'bout 2 tickets to a tropical shore 
Where we don't have to wear these winter clothes anymore 
Instead of turkey we'll have mahi-mahi grill 
And Pina Coladas in the blender chillin'.
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan 
Take me to the islands, put my feet in the sand 
Rocking to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean 
Singin 'Silent Night' with the palm trees blowin'.
Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan? 
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan. 
Well, everybody's praying for a Christmas so white 
Come to think about it, that'd be alright 
As long as it's sand and not snow on the ground 
And everyday our skin gets a little more brown 
We'll string some lights in a coconut tree 
I'll rub some oil on you, and you can rub some on me.
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan 
I can see us baby, on the beach hand in hand 
Rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean 
Baby, won't you say you and me we'll be going? 
Ooooo, I can almost feel my toes in the sand 
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan.
Don't worry baby, we'll celebrate plenty 
I'll buy you some shades and a brand new bikini 
We won't have to worry about the holiday rush 
It'll be you and me fallin' deeper in love.
Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan? 
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan. 
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan..

Every body stops  
And stares at me  
These two teeth are gone  
As you can see  
I don't know just who  
To blame for this catastrophe! 
But my one wish on Christmas Eve  
Is as plain as it can be!
All I want for Christmas 
Is my two front teeth 
My two front teeth 
See my two front teeth!
Gee, if I could only 
Have my two front teeth, 
Then I could wish you 
"Merry Christmas."
It seems so long since I could say 
"Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!" 
Gosh oh gee, how happy I'd be, 
If I could only whistle (thhhh, thhhh)
All I want for Christmas 
Is my two front teeth, 
My two front teeth, 
See my two front teeth.
Gee, if I could only 
Have my two front teeth, 
Then I could wish you 
"Merry Christmas!"

I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need 
I don't care about the presents 
Underneath the Christmas tree 
I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true... 
All I want for Christmas is  
You... yea yea 
I don't want a lot for Christmas 
There is just one thing I need 
(and I) Don't care about presents 
Underneath the Christmas tree 
I don't need to hang my stocking 
There upon the fireplace 
Santa Claus won't make me happy 
With a toy on Christmas day 
I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true 
All I want for Christmas is you... 
You baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas 
I won't even wish for snow 
(and I) I'm just gonna keep on waiting 
Underneath the mistletoe 
I won't make a list and send it 
To the North Pole for Saint Nick 
I won't even stay awake to 
Hear those magic reindeer click 
'Cause I just want you here tonight 
Holding on to me so tight 
What more can I do 
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you 
You baby.
All the lights are shining 
So brightly everywhere (so brightly yea) 
And the sound of children's 
Laughter fills the air 
And everyone is singing (oh yea) 
I hear those sleigh bells ringing 
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need   
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas 
This is all I'm asking for 
I just want to see baby 
Standing right outside my door 
Oh, I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true 
Baby, all I want for Christmas is 
You (You) baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby...  
All I want for Christmas is you baby...

If I wrote a letter to Santa Claus 
I would ask for just one thing. 

I don't need sleigh rides in the snow 
Don't want a Christmas that's blue 
Take back the tinsel, stockings, and bows 
'Cause all I want for Christmas is you. 

I don't need expensive things 
They don't matter to me 
All that I want, can't be found 
Underneath the Christmas tree. 

You are the angel atop my tree 
You are my dream come true 
Santa can't bring me what I need 
'Cause all I want for Christmas is you. 

I don't need expensive things 
They don't matter to me 
All that I want, can't be found 
Underneath the Christmas tree. 

You are the angel atop my tree 
You are my dream come true 
Santa can't bring me what I need 
'Cause all I want for Christmas is you 
'Cause all I want for Christmas is you 
'Cause all I want for Christmas is you.






Angels and men rejoice 
For tonight, darkness fell 
Into the dawn of love's light 
Sing a-le 
Sing alleluia!
All is well  
All is well 
Let there be peace on earth 
Christ is come, go and tell 
That he is in the manger 
Sing a-le 
Sing alleluia!
All is well  
All is well 
Lift up your voices and sing 
Born is now Emmanuel 
Born is our Lord and Savior 
Sing alleluia 
Sing alleluia 
All is well.

But you 
Don't come around 
And you don't call. 
Well 
It's just  
Like the season 
To be lonely 
And my heart  
Is beating  
For you only. 
Take my heart  
This Christmas 
And wrap it  
In a ribbon  
And a bow. 
Yes  
Take my heart  
This Christmas 
Take it  
Wherever you go. 
Everybody  
Has someone to hold 
Nestle by the fire  
In from the cold. 
But I don't hear  
The carols  
They're singing 
And I've only  
Got one thing good  
For giving. 
So, take my heart  
This Christmas 
And wrap it  
In a ribbon  
And a bow. 
Yes  
Take my heart  
This Christmas 
Take it  
Wherever you go. 
All my bells  
Are ringing  
Just for you 
And I got  
No desire  
For someone new. 
So, take my heart  
This Christmas 
And wrap it  
In a ribbon  
And a bow.
Yes  
Take my heart  
This Christmas 
Take it 
Where ever you go 
Take it  
Wherever you go.

All my heart this night rejoices,  
As I hear, far and near, sweetest angel voices 
"Christ is born", their choirs are singing 
Till the air, everywhere, now their joy is ringing.
Forth today the Conqueror goeth 
Who the foe, sin and woe, death and hell, o'er throweth 
God is man, man to deliver 
His dear Son now is one with our blood forever.
Shall we still dread God's displeasure, 
Who, to save, freely gave His most cherished Treasure? 
To redeem us, He hath given 
His own Son from the throne of His might in Heaven.
Should He who Himself imparted 
Aught withhold from the fold, leave us broken hearted? 
Should the Son of God not love us, 
Who, to cheer sufferers here, left His throne above us?
If our blessed Lord and Maker 
Hated men, would He then be of flesh partaker? 
If He in our woe delighted, 
Would He bear all the care of our race benighted?
He becomes the Lamb that taketh 
Sin away and for aye full atonement maketh 
For our life His own He tenders 
And our race, by His grace, meet for glory renders.
For it dawns, the promised morrow 
Of His birth, Who the earth rescues from her sorrow. 
God to wear our form descendeth 
Of His grace to our race here His Son He sendeth.
Hark! a voice from yonder manger 
Soft and sweet, doth entreat, "Flee from woe and danger 
Brethren, come, from all that grieves you 
You are freed, all you need I will surely give you".
Come, then, let us hasten yonder 
Here let all, great and small, kneel in awe and wonder, 
Love Him who with love is yearning 
Hail the star that from far bright with hope is burning.
Blessed Savior, let me find Thee! 
Keep Thou me close to Thee, cast me not behind Thee! 
Life of life, my heart Thou stillest, 
Calm I rest on Thy breast, all this void Thou fillest.
Thee, dear Lord, with heed I'll cherish; 
Live to Thee and with Thee, dying, shall not perish 
But shall dwell with Thee for ever, 
Far on high, in the joy that can alter never.

Sleep my child and peace attend thee  
All through the night.  
Guardian angels God will send thee 
All through the night. 
Soft the drowsy hours are creeping 
Hill and vale in slumber sleeping 
I my loving vigil keeping 
All through the night.
While the moon her watch is keeping 
All through the night. 
While the weary world is sleeping 
All through the night. 
O'er thy spirit gently stealing 
Visions of delight revealing 
Breathes a pure and holy feeling 
All through the night.
Hark, a solemn bell is ringing  
Clear through the night. 
You, my love, are heav'nward winging, 
Home through the night. 
Earthly dust from off thee shaken 
By good angels art though taken 
Soul immortal shalt though waken 
Home through the night.
Version 2 
Sleep, my child, and peace attend thee 
All through the night 
Guardian angels God will send thee 
All through the night. 
Soft the drowsy hours are creeping 
Hill and vale in slumber sleeping 
Mother dear, her watch is keeping 
All through the night.
God is here, thou'lt not be lonely 
All through the night. 
'Tis not I who guards thee only 
All through the night. 
Night's dark shades will soon be over 
Still my watchful care shall hover 
God with me his watch is keeping 
All through the night.

And on the windowpane outside 
A new world made of snow.
A million feathers falling down 
A million stars that touch the ground 
So many secrets to be found 
Amid the falling snow.
Maybe I am falling down 
Tell me should I touch the ground? 
Maybe I won't make a sound 
In the darkness all around.
The silence of a winter's night 
Brings memories I hold inside 
Remembering a blue moonlight 
Upon the fallen snow.
Maybe I am falling down 
Tell me should I touch the ground? 
Maybe I won't make a sound 
In the darkness all around.
I close my window to the night 
I leave the sky her tears of white 
And all is lit by candlelight 
Amid the falling snow.
And all is lit by candlelight 
Amid the falling snow.

And it brings back sweet memories   
Dear to me  
'Though it's faded and worn  
It's as precious as the morn  
When I found it   
'Neath our first Christmas tree.
Chorus: 
I thrill with every word, every line  
Guess I'm always sentimental   
'Round this time  
Pardon me if a tear falls   
Among my Christmas cheer  
It's the memory   
Of an old Christmas card.
Spoken: 
You know  
I don't know why   
I get to feeling sentimental  
About this time, every year;  
But, every time I see a Christmas card,  
I somehow can't help reminiscing  
About the very first Christmas   
That you and I spent together;  
What a beautiful Christmas card   
You gave me that year;  
Why, I know you must have looked   
Through thousands of cards  
To find that wonderful poem   
That still brings a tear to my eyes.
Chorus: 
I thrill with every word, every line  
Guess I'm always sentimental   
'Round this time  
Pardon me if a tear falls   
Among my Christmas cheer  
It's the memory   
Of an old Christmas card.

Window's candlelight shining bright  
For the whole world to see 
Children's eyes of sweet expectations 
Wondering what each present will hold 
Lying in their beds and impatient 
On long Christmas eves of old.
It used to be that all the family would gather for this one night 
It used to be that special feeling shared together  
Knowing Christmas was here one night a year.
How I miss that old fashioned Christmas! 
Memories that last through the years 
Call me sentimental, don't mind if you do 
I wish an old fashioned Christmas to you!

We're here to sing you  
Every little Christmas song we know.
So get ready   
Close or open your windows  
Take out or hide your money  
Honey, we don't care  
We're here to sing the staples  
Old fashioned Christmas carols  
Oh, here we go again.
Merry Christmas everybody  
Happy new year too.
We'll sing of chestnuts roastin'  
On a turtle doves comin' to town  
We'll sing of building snowman  
And pretending he's Jackson Browne.
Silver bells, silver bells  
Silver all the way  
What fun it is to give love  
On a one horse Christmas day  
It doesn't really matter  
The former or the latter  
Coz all we really wanna say is:
Merry Christmas everybody  
Happy new year too.
Come, they told me the Lord has come  
Let earth in heavenly peace  
Whispering hope, never smoke dope  
We'll go down in history  
History... 
We are the carol kings  
And we like to thank you all  
You've been so very kind  
We hope that you'll have a Christmas ball.
We really have to go  
Cos there's a dozen houses mo'  
But next year we'll be knockin' on your door again  
And soon we'll all be singin'  
The same song that you're hearin'  
Now people let me hear you sing:
Merry Christmas everybody  
Happy new year too.

Family faces 
Wide open spaces 
Covered with snow.
Right now, my mom there in the kitchen 
Basting the Christmas bird 
You'll have to take my word  
You can't find that at the automat.
An old fashioned fireplace 
Give me an old fashioned fireplace 
My heart remembers  
Smoldering embers 
Warming your glow.
I'd trade that whole Manhattan skyline 
The shimmering steel and chrome, 
For one old fashioned Christmas back home.

Angels from the realms of glory  
Wing your flight o'er all the earth  
Ye who sang creation's story 
Now proclaim Messiah's birth 
Come and worship 
Come and worship 
Worship Christ, the newborn King!
Shepherds, in the fields abiding 
Watching o'er your flocks by night 
God with man is now residing 
Yonder shines the Infant light 
Come and worship 
Come and worship 
Worship Christ, the newborn King!
Sages, leave your contemplations 
Brighter visions beam afar 
Seek the great desire of nations 
Ye have seen His natal star 
Come and worship 
Come and worship 
Worship Christ, the newborn King!
Saints before the altar bending 
Watching long in hope and fear 
Suddenly the Lord, descending 
In His temple shall appear. 
Come and worship, 
Come and worship, 
Worship Christ, the newborn King!
Sinners, wrung with true repentance 
Doomed for guilt to endless pains 
Justice now revokes the sentence 
Mercy calls you, break your chains 
Come and worship 
Come and worship 
Worship Christ, the newborn King!
Though an Infant now we view Him 
He shall fill His Father's throne 
Gather all the nations to Him 
Every knee shall then bow down. 
Come and worship 
Come and worship 
Worship Christ, the newborn King!
All creation, join in praising 
God, the Father, Spirit, Son 
Evermore your voices raising 
To the eternal Three in One 
Come and worship 
Come and worship 
Worship Christ, the newborn King!

Take this man to prison, the man heard Herod say,  
And then four squads of soldiers came and carried him away. 
Chained up between two watchmen, Peter tried to sleep, 
But beyond the walls an endless prayer was lifting for his keep. 
Then a light cut through the darkness of a lonely prison cell, 
And the chains that bound the man of God, just opened up and fell, 
And running to his people before the break of day, 
There was only one thing on his mind, only one thing to say:
Angels watching over me, every move I make, 
Angels watching over me! 
Angels watching over me, every step I take, 
Angels watching over me!
God only knows the times my life was threatened just today 
A reckless car ran out of gas before it ran my way 
Near misses all around me, accidents unknown 
Though I never see with human eyes the hands that lead me home 
But I know they're all around me all day and through the night. 
When the enemy is closing in, I know sometimes they fight 
To keep my fight from falling, I'll never turn away 
If you're asking whats protecting me, then you're gonna hear me say:
Got His angels watching over me, every move I make, 
Angles watching over me! 
Angels watching over me, every step I take, 
Angels watching over me!
Angels watching over me 
Angels watching over me.
Got his angels watching over me, every move I make, 
Angels watching over me! 
Angels watching over me, every step I take, 
Angels watching over me!
Angels watching over me, 
Angels watching over me, 
Angels watching over me, 
Angels watching over me!
Though I never see with human eyes, the hands that lead me home.

All night, all day  
Angels watching over me, my Lord 
All night, all day 
Angels watching over me.
Sun is a-setting in the west 
Angels watching over me, my Lord 
Sleep my child, take your rest 
Angels watching over me.
All night, all day 
Angels watching over me, my Lord 
All night, all day, 
Angels watching over me.

Angels we have heard on high  
Singing sweetly through the night 
And the mountains in reply  
Echoing their brave delight  
Gloria in excelsis Deo  
Gloria in excelsis Deo! 
Shepherds, why this jubilee?  
Why these songs of happy cheer?  
What great brightness did you see?  
What glad tiding did you hear?   
Gloria, in excelsis Deo 
Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 
Come to Bethlehem and see  
Him whose birth the angels sing 
Come, adore on bended knee  
Christ, the Lord, the new-born King   
Gloria, in excelsis Deo 
Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 
See him in a manger laid  
Whom the angels praise above 
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid 
While we raise our hearts in love 
Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

'Cuz all the ones I dream about 
You are the one that makes my love shout 
You see, you are the only one I care for. 
Remember the time  
We swam naked in your father's pool? 
Boy, he was upset that night 
But boy, was that ever cool!
Remember that night  
We played poker for money? 
And you robbed me blind 
Remember how you used to scream so loud  
'Cuz you, you hated that number 9?
Hey, I saw your sister skatin'  
On the lake this afternoon 
Good heaven, how she's grown 
She swoons the boy skaters, she's so tall.
But of all your father's children 
All your father's children, baby 
You know you are the finest of them all 
You are brighter than the northern star. 
And I, last night I spent another lonely Christmas 
Darling, darling, you should've been there 
You see, of all the ones I dream about 
You are the one that makes my love shout 
You see, you are the only one I care for, yeah.
My mama used to say, always trust your lover 
But now I guess that only applies to her 
Cuz baby, you promised me 
Baby, you promised me you'd never leave 
Then you died on the 25th day of December. 
Oh baby, last night 
Oh, I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas 
Darling, baby, you, you should've been there 
'Cuz all the ones I dream about 
You are the one that makes my love shout 
You see, you are the only one I care for, yeah. 
Your father said it was pneumonia 
Your mother said it was stress 
But the doctor said you were dead  
And I, I say it's senseless 
Every Christmas night for 7 years now 
I drink banana daiquiris till I'm blind.
As long as I can hear you smiling, baby 
You won't hear my tears 
Another lonely Christmas is mine, yeah, mine, yeah 
Another lonely Christmas is mine. 
Last night, yeah, I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas 
Darling, darling, you should've been there, yeah 
'Cuz all the ones I dream about 
You are the one that make my love shout 
You see, you are the only one I care for.

Raise a glass for auld lang syne  
Come on, rock it up for all mankind.

Kissing under the mistletoe

All dressed up  
So here we go  
Do I hear sleigh bells, in the snow?
Another Rock 'N' Roll Christmas

Tonight old Santa never, ever stops  
Going down the chimney tops.
You'll be rocking  
In your stocking  
When you see your big suprise  
Cause I'll be rocking  
In your stocking  
You won't believe your big blue eyes.

When this Word was clearly spoken 
All that came to be was right. 
All creation had a language 
Words to say what must be said 
All day long the heavens whispered 
Signing words in scarlet red. 
Some have failed to understand it 
So God spoke His final Word 
On a silent night in Judah's hills  
A baby's cry was heard. 
Glory! sang the angel chorus 
Glory! echoed back the night 
Love has come to walk among us 
Christ the Lord is born this night. 
All creation sing His praises 
Earth and heaven praise His name 
All who live come join the chorus 
Find the words His love proclaim. 

Find the words His love proclaim.

As lately we watch'd o'er our fields thro' the night  
A star there was seen of such glorious light  
All thro' the night, angels did sing 
Carols so sweet of the birth of a King. 
A King of such beauty was ne'er before seen,  
And Mary His mother so like a queen  
Blessed be the hour, welcome the morn,  
For Christ our dear Saviour on earth now is born. 
His throne is a manger, His court is a loft,  
But troops of bright angels, in lays sweet and soft,  
Him they proclaim, our Christ by name,  
And earth, sky and air straight are filled with his fame. 
Then shepherds, be joyful; salute your new King,  
Let hills and vales ring to the song that ye sing  
Blessed be the hour, welcome the morn,  
For Christ our dear Saviour on earth now is born.

The one thing we're looking for  
Is something we can't see  
Far more precious than silver 
And more splendid than gold 
Is something to treasure 
But is something we can't hold. 
As long as there's Christmas 
I truly believe 
That hope is the greatest of the gifts  
We'll receive  
We'll receive. 
As we all pray together 
It's the time to rejoice 
And though we may look different 
We are singing with one voice. 
As long as there's Christmas 
I truly believe 
That hope is the greatest of the gifts 
We'll receive. 
There is more 
So much more 
To this time of year 
To this time of year 
Than sleigh bells and holly 
Mistletoes and snow 
Those things will come and go 
Come and go. 
As long as there is Christmas 
I truly do believe  
That hope is the greatest of the gifts 
We will receive 
We'll receive.
As long as there's Christmas  
I truly believe 
I truly believe  
That hope is the greatest of the gifts 
We'll receive. 
That hope is the greatest gift we'll receive!

As with gladness, men of old  
Did the guiding star behold  
As with joy they hailed its light 
Leading onward, beaming bright 
So, most glorious Lord, may we 
Evermore be led to Thee.
As with joyful steps they sped 
To that lowly manger bed 
There to bend the knee before 
Him Whom Heaven and earth adore 
So may we with willing feet 
Ever seek Thy mercy seat.
As they offered gifts most rare 
At that manger rude and bare 
So may we with holy joy 
Pure and free from sin's alloy 
All our costliest treasures bring 
Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King.
Holy Jesus, every day 
Keep us in the narrow way 
And, when earthly things are past 
Bring our ransomed souls at last 
Where they need no star to guide 
Where no clouds Thy glory hide.
In the heavenly country bright 
Need they no created light 
Thou its Light, its Joy, its Crown 
Thou its Sun which goes not down 
There forever may we sing 
Alleluias to our King!

Hail Mary 
full of grace 
the Lord is with thee
blessed art thou amongst women
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary 
Mother of God
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

Away in a manger  
No crib for His bed  
The little Lord Jesus 
Laid down His sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky 
Looked down where He lay 
The little Lord Jesus 
Asleep on the hay.
The cattle are lowing 
The poor Baby wakes 
But little Lord Jesus 
No crying He makes.
I love Thee, Lord Jesus 
Look down from the sky 
And stay by my side 
'Til morning is nigh.
Be near me, Lord Jesus 
I ask Thee to stay 
Close by me forever 
And love me I pray.
Bless all the dear children 
In Thy tender care 
And take us to heaven 
To live with Thee there.

I really can't stay  
Baby, it's cold outside 
I've got to go away 
Baby, it's cold outside 
This evening has been  
Been hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice 
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice 
My mother will start to worry  
Beautiful, what's your hurry 
My father will be pacing the floor 
Listen to the fireplace roar 
So really I'd better scurry  
Beautiful, please don't hurry 
Well, maybe just a half a drink more  
Put some music on while I pour.
The neighbors might think   
Baby, it's bad out there 
Say, what's in this drink?  
No cabs to be had out there 
I wish I knew how  
Your eyes are like starlight now 
To break this spell  
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell 
I ought to say no, no, no sir  
Mind if I move a little closer 
At least I'm gonna say that I tried  
What's the sense in hurting my pride? 
I really can't stay  
Baby, don't hold out 
Ahh, but it's cold outside.
C'mon baby  

I simply must go 
Baby, it's cold outside 
The answer is no  
Ooh baby, it's cold outside 
This welcome has been  
I'm lucky that you dropped in 
So nice and warm  
Look out the window at that storm 
My sister will be suspicious  
Man, your lips look so delicious 
My brother will be there at the door 
Waves upon a tropical shore 
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious  
Gosh, your lips look delicious 
Well, maybe just a half a drink more  
Never such a blizzard before.
I've got to go home  
Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there 
Say, lend me your comb  
It's up to your knees out there 
You've really been grand  
Your eyes are like starlight now 
But don't you see?  
How can you do this thing to me 
There's bound to be talk tomorrow  
Making my life long sorrow 
At least there will be plenty implied  
If you caught pneumonia and died 
I really can't stay  
Get over that cold out 
Ahh, but it's cold outside
Baby, it's cold outside  
Brr, its cold 
It's cold out there 
Cant you stay awhile longer baby? 
Well, I really shouldn't, alright 
Make it worth your while baby 
Ahh, do that again.

The snow's coming down

The church bells in town

All ringing in song

Full of happy sounds

Baby, please come home.
They're singing "Deck The Halls" 
But it's not like Christmas at all 
'Cause I remember when you were here 
And all the fun we had last year.

Pretty lights on the tree

Shoppin' all around 
For every pretty toy.
Baby's big brother 
Is busy with his toys 
And he's shinin' up the chimney 
For Santa Claus.
It's baby's first Christmas 
It's somethin' to see 
Mommy and Daddy 
Trimmin' baby's Christmas tree.
It's a very special Christmas 
A blessin' from above 
It's baby's first Christmas 
A Christmas full of love.
It's baby's first Christmas 
And oh, what a joy 
Shoppin' all around 
For every pretty toy.
It's a very special Christmas 
A blessing from above 
It's baby's first Christmas 
A Christmas full of love.

I haven't seen them in a while. 
You've been good, busier than ever 
We small talk, work and the weather 
Your guard is up, and I know why. 
Because the last time you saw me  
Is still burned in the back of your mind 
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die. 
So this is me swallowing my pride 
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night 
And I go back to December all the time. 
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you  
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine 
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright  
I go back to December all the time. 
These days, I haven't been sleeping 
Staying up, playing back myself leaving 
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call. 
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times 
I watched you laughing from the passenger side 
And realized I loved you in the fall. 
And then the cold came, the dark days  
When fear crept into my mind  
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye. 
So this is me swallowing my pride 
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night 
And I go back to December all the time. 
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you 
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine  
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind 
I go back to December all the time. 
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile 
So good to me, so right 
And how you held me in your arms that September night 
The first time you ever saw me cry. 
Maybe this is wishful thinking 
Probably mindless dreaming 
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right. 
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't 
So if the chain is on your door, I understand.
This is me swallowing my pride  
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night  
And I go back to December. 
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you  
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine 
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright  
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind  
I go back to December all the time, all the time.


As the echoes ring of the Christmas bells  
Angel songs in our hearts resound again  
Singing peace on earth and good will to men!
Chorus: 
Bring pine and fir tree, weave the garlands bright  
Gladden the temple of the King tonight!  
Christmas is here! Fill it with cheer  
Make it glorious with joy and light.
Bring good will to the suffering and sad  
Speak the tender word that shall make them glad  
Tell them how, o'er the hills of Bethlehem  
When the angels sang, 'twas good news for them.
Chorus: 
Bring pine and fir tree, weave the garlands bright  
Gladden the temple of the King tonight!  
Christmas is here! Fill it with cheer  
Make it glorious with joy and light.
Peace on earth! bid all strife and tumult cease  
For this night again gives the Lord His peace  
While our hands shall His temple beautify  
Carol, glory be unto God most high.
Chorus: 
Bring pine and fir tree, weave the garlands bright  
Gladden the temple of the King tonight!  
Christmas is here! Fill it with cheer  
Make it glorious with joy and light.
So glad hearts on this happy Christmas night  
Bring your gifts of love, make His altar bright  
Sing glad songs that shall sweetly sound as when  
Angels sang of peace and good will to men.
Chorus: 
Bring pine and fir tree, weave the garlands bright  
Gladden the temple of the King tonight!  
Christmas is here! Fill it with cheer  
Make it glorious with joy and light.


Beautiful star of Bethlehem  
Shining afar through shadows dim 
Giving the light to those who long have gone 
Guiding the Wise Men on their way 
Unto the place where Jesus lay 
Beautiful star of Bethlehem 
Shine on (shine on).
Oh beautiful star (beautiful, beautiful star) 
Of Bethlehem (star of Bethlehem) 
Shine upon us until the glory dawns

Unto the land of perfect day 
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem 
Shine on (shine on).
Beautiful star, the hope of light 
Guiding the pilgrims through the night 
Over the mountains 'til the break of dawn 
Into the light of perfect day  
It will give out a lovely ray

Tonight the stars shine for the children  
And light the way for dreams to fly  
Tonight our love comes wrapped in ribbons  
The world is right and hopes are high.
And from a dark and frosted window  
A child appears to search the sky  
Because it's Christmas  
Because it's Christmas.
Tonight belongs to all the children  
Tonight their joy rings through the air  
And so, we send our tender blessings  
To all the children everywhere.
To see the smiles and hear the laughter  
A time to give, a time to share  
Because it's Christmas  
Because it's Christmas.
For now and forever for all of the children  
And for the children in us all.
Tonight belongs to all the children  
Tonight their joy rings through the air  
And so, we send our tender blessings  
To all the children everywhere.
To see the smiles and hear the laughter  
A time to give, a time to share  
Because it's Christmas  
For now and forever  
For all of the children  
And for the children in us all.

If my folks were wiser and older 
They'd know kids and toys don't need sleep. 
Don't be bad, little cotton dolly 
See how nice Mickey Mouse sleeps now? 
Even my brass drummer boy has stopped all his noise 
Cause he knows it's past bedtime for toys.
Spoken: 
You know, every Christmas 
Santa Claus goes all over the world 
With his reindeer, sled, and a big bag of toys  
And he'll come to your house this year too. 
But sometimes, just sometimes 
He doesn't have enough time  
To see every little boy and girl 
Because the world is so big  
So maybe we should sing a song 
For all the children that Santa didn't visit.
Bless the child who has no tin soldier 
No brass drummer boy to put to bed 
He will still grow wiser and older 
Loving one small rag doll instead.
He won't have a cotton dolly 
Mickey Mouse won't come to his house 
Hold that rag doll to your heart  
Nothing can destroy the beauty 
One shall find in one small toy.

Refrain: 
Behold that star! 
Behold that star up yonder 
Behold that star!  
It is the star of Bethlehem.
There was no room found in the inn 
It is the star of Bethlehem 
For Him who was born free from sin 
It is the star of Bethlehem.  
Refrain: 
Behold that star! 
Behold that star up yonder 
Behold that star!  
It is the star of Bethlehem.
The wise men traveled from the East 
It is the star of Bethlehem 
To worship Him, the Prince of Peace 
It is the star of Bethlehem. 
Refrain: 
Behold that star! 
Behold that star up yonder 
Behold that star!  
It is the star of Bethlehem.
A song broke forth upon the night 
It is the star of Bethlehem 
From angel hosts all robed in white 
It is the star of Bethlehem. 
Refrain: 
Behold that star! 
Behold that star up yonder 
Behold that star!  
It is the star of Bethlehem.

We were dreamers not so long ago 
But one by one we all had to grow up 
When it seems the magic's slipped away 
We find it all again on Christmas day.
Believe in what your heart is saying 
Hear the melody that's playing 
There's no time to waste 
There's so much to celebrate 
Believe in what you feel inside  
And give your dreams the wings to fly 
You have everything you need 
If you just believe.
Trains move quickly to their journey's end 
Destinations are where we begin again 
Ships go sailing far across the sea 
Trusting starlight to get where they need to be 
When it seems that we have lost our way 
We find ourselves again on Christmas day.
Believe in what your heart is saying 
Hear the melody that's playing 
There's no time to waste 
There's so much to celebrate 
Believe in what you feel inside  
And give your dreams the wings to fly 
You have everything you need 
If you just believe.
If you just believe  
If you just believe  
If you just believe 
Just believe 
Just believe.

My baby's gone 
I have no friends 
To wish me greetings 
Once again 
Choirs will be singing, "Silent Night" 
Oh, Christmas carols, by candlelight.
Please come home for Christmas 
Please come home for Christmas 
If not for Christmas, by New Year's Night.
Friends and relations 
Send salutations 
Just as sure as the stars shine above.
This is Christmas, Christmas my dear 
The time of year to be with the one that you love.
Then will you tell me, you'll never more roam? 
Christmas and New Year will find you home? 
There'll be no more sorrow 
No grief or pain 
'Cause I'll be happy that it's Christmas once again.

Beautiful robes", said the young girl to Joseph,  
Fair with her first-born on Bethlehem Down. 
Bethlehem Down is full of the starlight,  
Winds for the spices, and stars for the gold,  
Mary for sleep, and for lullaby music,  
Songs of a shepherd by Bethlehem fold. 
When He is King, they will clothe Him in grave-sheets,  
Myrrh for embalming, and wood for a crown,  
He that lies now in the white arms of Mary,  
Sleeping so lightly on Bethlehem Down.
Here He has peace and a short while for dreaming,  
Close-huddled oxen to keep him from cold,  
Mary for love, and for lullaby music,  
Songs of a shepherd by Bethlehem Down.

Just a chance that maybe we'll find  
Better days.
Cuz I don't need boxes wrapped in strings 
And desire and love and empty things 
Just a chance that maybe we'll find  
Better days. 
So take these words 
And sing out loud  
Cuz everyone is forgiven now 
Cuz tonight's the night  
The world begins again. 
And it's someplace simple  
Where we could live 
And something only you can give 
And thats faith and trust and peace  
While we're alive  
And the one poor Child that saved this world 
And there's 10 million more  
Who probably could 
If we all just stopped  
And said a prayer for them. 
So take these words 
And sing out loud  
Cuz everyone is forgiven now 
Cuz tonight's the night  
The world begins again. 
I wish everyone was loved tonight 
And somehow stop this endless fight 
Just a chance that maybe we'll find  
Better days. 
So take these words 
And sing out loud 
Cuz everyone is forgiven now 
Cuz tonight's the night  
The world begins again 
Cuz tonight's the night  
The world begins again.

In the little village of Bethlehem  
There lay a Child one day  
And the sky was bright  
With a holy light  
O'er the place where Jesus lay. 
Alleluia!  
O, how the angels sang!  
Alleluia  
How it rang!  
And the sky was bright  
With a holy light  
'Twas the birthday of a King. 
Humble birthplace  
But Oh!  
How much God gave to us that day!  
From the manger bed what a path has led  
What a perfect holy way! 
Alleluia!  
O how the angels sang!  
Alleluia  
How it rang!  
And the sky was bright  
With a Holy light  
'Twas the birthday of a King.

And too far to go home 
I ran in to a friend of a friend 
Standing in checkout line 
She said, "I've spent too much already 
And there's gifts I just can't find" 
I walked her home and when she opened up her door 
I'm not sure what happened then 
Guess magic took it's course.
Blame it on the mistletoe 
'Cause what happened here nobody knows 
How could something simple as a kiss 
Change my holiday like this 
And we held each other all night long 
And we fell asleep to a Christmas song 
Playin' on the radio 
Blame it on the mistletoe.
I woke up, she was wrappin' gifts beneath the tree 
She said, "I know it's early, so I thought I'd let you sleep" 
Then she insisted I get up and take a look outside 
Hey sleepyhead, it must have snowed at least a foot last night 
That's when I saw it hangin' up above my head 
She threw her arms around my neck 
Laughin' as she said
"Blame it on the mistletoe." 
'Cause what happened here nobody knows 
How could something simple as a kiss 
Change my holiday like this 
And we held each other all night long 
And we fell asleep to a Christmas song 
Playin' on the radio 
Blame it on the mistletoe.

Born He was of her body 
Very God ere time began 
Born in time the Son of man.
Chorus: 
Eya! Ihesus hodie 
Natus est de Virgine.
In a manger of an ass 
Jesus lay and lulled was 
Born to die upon the Tree 
Pro peccante homine. 
Chorus: 
Eya! Ihesus hodie 
Natus est de Virgine.
Sweet and blissful was the song 
Changed of the Angel throng 
"Peace on earth," Alleluya 
In excelsis gloria. 
Chorus: 
Eya! Ihesus hodie 
Natus est de Virgine.
Fare three Kings from far-off land 
Incense, gold and myrrh in hand 
In Bethlehem the Babe they see 
Stelle ducti lumine. 
Chorus: 
Eya! Ihesus hodie 
Natus est de Virgine.
Make we merry on this fest 
In quo Christus natus est 
On this Child I pray you call 
To assoil and save us all. 
Chorus: 
Eya! Ihesus hodie 
Natus est de Virgine.

I'll have a blue Christmas without you  
I'll be so blue 
Thinking about you  
Decorations of red 
On a green Christmas tree 
Won't mean a thing 
If you're not here with me.
I'll have a blue Christmas, 
That's certain 
And when that blue heartache 
Starts hurting 
You'll be doing all right 
With your Christmas of white 
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.

The boar's head in hand bring I  
Bedeck'd with bays and rosemary. 
I pray you, my masters, be merry  
Quot estis in convivio.

The boar's head, as I understand  
Is the rarest dish in all this land  
Which thus bedeck'd with a gay garland   
Let us servire cantico.

Reddens laudes Domino
Our steward hath provided this  
In honor of the King of Bliss;  
Which, on this day to be served is  
In Reginensi atrio.
Caput apri defero  
Reddens laudes Domino.

Away in a manger, you heard a baby cry 
It was the cry of the Son of God 
A little baby boy 
Born in that manger to bring the world joy.
So hush up little baby 
You know not what you'll do 
You'll bring the world peace and love 
And teach them while you do 
You have nothing to fear  
Because you know 
God is with you all the way 
That little important baby 
Born on Christmas day.
Many people soon gathered  
Round that tiny run down barn 
They knew not of what they saw 
Then came three all dressed 
In fancy robes, silks and furs 
This was the first indication 
Of the importance of his birth.
So hush up little baby 
You know not what you'll do 
You'll bring the world peace and love 
And teach them while you do 
You have nothing to fear  
Because you know 
That God will lead the way 
That little important baby 
Born on Christmas day.
We expected a soldier to save us from our plight 
All dressed in shiny armor, ready for a fight 
But instead He sent a little baby boy 
All filled with love and happiness 
To bring the world joy.
So hush up little baby 
You know not what you'll do 
You'll bring the world peace and love 
And teach them while you do 
You have nothing to fear  
Because you know 
That God will lead the way 
That little important baby 
Born on Christmas day.
That God will lead the way 
That little important baby 
Born on Christmas day 
That little important baby 
Born on Christmas day.

But a star in the Heavens, a sign full of wonder 
Announcing the coming of the King of kings. 
Rejoice, o world, your Savior has come 
Through the love of a virgin's womb 
Son of God, Son of man, born that we may have life 
You were born that we may have life. 
A throne in a manger, the cross in a cradle 
The hidden revealing this glorious plan 
Of a Child who would suffer, a Child who would conquer 
The sin of every woman, the sin of every man. 
Rejoice, o world, your Savior has come 
Through the love of a virgin's womb 
Son of God, son of man, born that we may have life 
You were born that we may have life. 
Rejoice, o world, your Savior has come 
Through the love of a virgin's womb 
Son of God, Son of man 
You were born that we may have life. 
Rejoice, o world, your Savior has come  
Through the love of a virgin's womb 
Son of God, Son of man, born that we may have life  
You were born that we may have life  
You were born that we may have life. 
Rejoice, o world, rejoice  
Rejoice, o world, Hallelujah, the Savior has come  
Rejoice, o world, join with the angels 
Rejoice, o world, rejoice. 
Rejoice, o world, for the King of kings 
And the Lord of lords 
Rejoice, o world, a Savior is born 
Who brings us life and brings peace. 
Born that we may have life  
You were born that we may have life  
You were born that we may have life.

Break forth, O beauteous heavenly light  
And usher in the morning  
O shepherds, shrink not with afright  
But hear the angel's warning.  
This Child, now weak  in infancy  
Our confidence and joy shall be  
The power of Satan breaking  
Our peace eternal making. 
All blessing, thanks and praise to thee  
Lord Jesus Christ, be given  
Thou hast our Brother deigned to be  
Our foes in sunder riven.  
O grant us through our day of grace  
With constant praise to seek Thy face  
Grant us ere long in glory  
With praises to adore thee.

I have traveled many moonless nights  
Cold and weary with a babe inside  
And I wonder what I've done  
Holy Father, You have come  
And chosen me now to carry Your Son.
I am waiting in a silent prayer  
I am frightened by the load I bear  
In a world as cold as stone  
Must I walk this path alone?  
Be with me now.  
Be with me now.
Breath of heaven  
Hold me together  
Be forever near me  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Lighten my darkness  
Pour over me Your holiness   
For You are holy  
Breath of heaven.
Do you wonder as You watch my face  
If a wiser one should have had my place?  
But I offer all I am  
For the mercy of Your plan  
Help me be strong  
Help me be  
Help me.
Breath of heaven  
Hold me together  
Be forever near me  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Lighten my darkness  
Pour over me Your holiness  
For You are holy.
Breath of heaven  
Hold me together  
Be forever near me  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Lighten my darkness  
Pour over me Your holiness  
For You are holy  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven.

Brightest and best of the sons of the morning  
Dawn on our darkness and lend us Thine aid  
Star of the East, the horizon adorning  
Guide where our infant Redeemer is laid. 
Cold on His cradle the dewdrops are shining  
Low lies His head with the beasts of the stall  
Angels adore Him in slumber reclining  
Maker and Monarch and Savior of all. 
Say, shall we yield Him, in costly devotion  
Odors of Edom and offerings divine?  
Gems of the mountain and pearls of the ocean  
Myrrh from the forest, or gold from the mine?
Vainly we offer each ample oblation  
Vainly with gifts would His favor secure  
Richer by far is the heart's adoration  
Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor.

Bring a torch, Jeannette, Isabella  
Bring a torch, come swiftly and run  
Christ is born, tell the folk of the village  
Jesus is sleeping in His cradle  
Ah, ah, beautiful is the Mother  
Ah, ah, beautiful is her Son.
It is wrong when the Child is sleeping  
It is wrong to talk so loud  
Silence all, as you gather around 
Lest your noise should waken Jesus 
Hush! hush! see how fast He slumbers 
Hush! hush! see how fast He sleeps.
Hasten now, good folk of the village 
Hasten now, the Christ-Child to see 
You will find him asleep in the manger 
Quietly come and whisper softly 
Hush, hush, peacefully now He slumbers 
Hush, hush, peacefully now He sleeps.
Softly to the little stable 
Softly for a moment come 
Look and see how charming is Jesus 
How He is white, His cheeks are rosy 
Hush! hush! see how the Child is sleeping 
Hush! hush! see how He smiles in his dreams.

There's one big thing I missed 
You see my Daddy's working  
Far away from here 
And I know Santa 
I asked for a Barbie doll 
And a brand new soccer ball 
But I'd trade it all 
For just one gift this year.
Bring him home Santa  
Bring him home to Mom and me 
Let us wake up Christmas morning 
And find him standing by our tree 
You can pick him up on your way 
He could ride there in your sleigh 
Don't make him spend Christmas all alone 
Bring him home.
And Santa 
Here's a picture that I drew 
Of him in his dress blues 
Mama says  
Our country needs him over there 
And you know Santa 
This whole year I've been good 
And I was hoping that you would 
Do all you could to answer my prayer.
Bring him home Santa  
Bring him home to Mom and me 
Let us wake up Christmas morning 
And find him standing by our tree 
You can pick him up on your way 
He could ride there in your sleigh 
Don't make him spend Christmas all alone 
Bring him home.
Bring him home 
Bring him home 
Bring him home.


Buon Natale to everyone  
Happy new year and lots of fun  
Buon Natale 
May all your wishes come true  
Buon Natale in Italy means  
"A Merry Christmas to you".
Far away across the sea  
In sunny Italy  
There's a quaint little town  
Not a clock has been wound  
For over a century.
They don't know the time or year  
And no one seems to care  
And this is the reason   
The Christmas season  
Is celebrated all year.
Buon Natale means 
Merry Christmas to you  
Buon Natale to everyone  
Happy New Year and lots of fun  
Buon Natale 
May all your wishes come true  
Buon Natale in Italy means  
"A Merry Christmas to you".

The  winter season of the year  
When to this world our Lord was born  
The ox and donkey, so they say  
Did keep his holy presence warm.
How many oxen and donkeys now  
If they were there when first he came  
How many oxen and donkeys you know 
At such a time would do the same?
And on that night it has been told  
These humble beasts so rough and rude  
Throughout the night of holy birth  
Drank no water, ate no food.
How many oxen and donkeys now  
If they were there when first he came  
How many oxen and donkeys you know 
At such a time would do the same?
As soon as to these humble beasts  
Appeared our Lord, so mild and sweet  
With joy they knelt before his Grace  
And gently kissed His tiny feet.
How many oxen and donkeys now  
If they were there when first he came  
How many oxen and donkeys you know 
At such a time would do the same?

When I was but a youngster  
Christmas meant one thing  
That I'd be getting lots of toys that day  
I learned a whole lot different,  
When my Mother sat me down,  
And taught me to spell Christmas this way: 
"C" is for the Christ child, born upon this day,  
"H" for herald angels in the night,  
"R" means our Redeemer,  
"I" means Israel,  
"S" is for the star that shone so bright,  
"T" is for three wise men, they who traveled far,  
"M" is for the manger where he lay,  
"A" is for all He stands for,  
"S" means shepherds came. 
And that's why there's a Christmas day,  
And that's why there's a Christmas day.

Wonder who could that be in your stockin' 
Suit of red and cheeks of cherry 
Lookin' extraordinary 
Spare me cause you scare with your gawkin' 
Hold your applause  
Pick up your jaws 
Call me Claus, hoah! 
I got the spirit of the season in me 
Spreadin' joy and toys a'plenty 
Nimbly down your chimney I'll be bumpin' 
Give me room 'cause I'm a packin'  
Only time for toys and snackin' 
Love to stay here yackin' 
But I'm humpin' 
I got a cause 
No time to pause 
They call me Claus.
Woah, call me Santa 
Call me Kringle 
Call me Old Saint Nick 
All those have a beautiful ring 
Pleasin' is the reason 
And the season's a kick 
When you're Santa  
Baby, you gotta swing 
Swing, I dare ya, yeah!
Hey, call me Santa 
Call me Kringle 
Call me Old Saint Nick  
All those have a beautiful ring 
Pleasin' is the reason 
And the season's a kick 
When you're Santa  
Baby, you gotta swing.
So while in your jammies sleepin' 
Roof to roof I'll be a leapin' 
Quickly if your creepin' for a peepin'.
The oohs and aahs 
Are all because 
They call me Claus.
Hold your applause 
Hey, watch the paws 
They call me Claus.

Draughty stable with an open door  
Mary cradling the babe she bore  
The prince of glory is his name.
Refrain:  
Oh, now carry me to Bethlehem  
To see the Lord appear to men  
Just as poor as was the stable then  
The prince of glory when he came.
Star of silver sweeps across the skies  
Show where Jesus in the manger lies  
Shepherds swiftly from your stupor rise  
To see the Saviour of the world.
Refrain:  
Oh, now carry me to Bethlehem  
To see the Lord appear to men  
Just as poor as was the stable then  
The prince of glory when he came.
Mine are riches from thy poverty  
From thine innocence, eternity  
Mine, forgiveness by thy death for me  
Child of sorrow, for my joy.
Refrain:  
Oh, now carry me to Bethlehem  
To see the Lord appear to men  
Just as poor as was the stable then  
The prince of glory when he came.
Angels, sing again the song you sang  
Bring God's glory to the heart of man  
Sing, "Bethlehem's little baby can  
Be salvation to the soul."
Refrain:  
Oh, now carry me to Bethlehem  
To see the Lord appear to men  
Just as poor as was the stable then  
The prince of glory when he came.

How do you count all the stars in the sky?  
How can you measure the love of a mother? 
Or how can you write down a baby's first cry?  
Candlelight, angel light, firelight and star-glow  
Shine on His cradle till breaking of dawn 
Gloria, gloria in excelsis Deo!  
Angels are singing; the Christ Child is born. 
Shepherds and wise men will kneel and adore Him  
Seraphim round Him their vigil will keep; 
Nations proclaim Him their Lord and their Saviour 
But Mary will hold Him and sing Him to sleep 
Candlelight, angel light, firelight and star-glow  
Shine on His cradle till breaking of dawn 
Gloria, gloria in excelsis Deo!  
Angels are singing; the Christ Child is born. 
Find him at Bethlehem laid in a manger 
Christ our Redeemer asleep in the hay 
Godhead incarnate and hope of salvation 
A Child with His mother that first Christmas Day 
Candlelight, angel light, firelight and star-glow  
Shine on His cradle till breaking of dawn 
Gloria, gloria in excelsis Deo!  
Angels are singing; the Christ Child is born.

Can't stop the sun from shining 
Until the day turns into night. 
All over the world  
They try to steal our joy  
But our spirit can't be broken  
Every man and woman, girl or boy. 
Can't stop the joy 
Can't stop the reason 
Christmas lives inside of us 
From season to season. 
Can't stop the pain 
Of all the hatred in the world 
There'll be no hate, no war 
In God we'll trust  
And peace on earth. 
Cause you can't stop Christmas   
There's a feeling we share  
We never knew it, but it always was there  
For united we will stand  
Brother to brother, hand in hand. 
With one song, one dream, one prayer 
Let your voice be heard  
For His blessings surround us  
All across the world. 
Can't stop the joy 
Can't stop the reason 
Christmas lives inside of us 
From season to season. 
Can't stop the pain  
Of all the hated in the world  
There'll be no hate, no war  
In God we'll trust  
And peace on earth   
Cause you can't stop Christmas. 
Reach out for those in need  
For that magic of Christmas  
Is to give and to believe. 
Can't stop the joy 
Can't stop the reason 
Christmas lives inside of us 
From season to season. 

The birds came from afar  
In that full might of a glory. 
With one melodious voice  
They sweetly did rejoice  
And sang the wondrous story. 
Sang, praising God on high  
Enthroned above the sky  
And his fair mother Mary. 
The eagle left his lair  
Came winging through the air  
His message loud arising. 
And to his joyous cry  
The sparrow made reply  
His answer sweetly voicing. 
Overcome are death and strife  
This night is born new life  
The robin sang rejoicing. 
When rose the eastern star  
The birds came from afar. 
Catalonian: El Cant dels Ocells 
En veure despuntar 
El major illuminar 
En la nit mes joiosa;  
Els ocellettes cantant a festejarlo van, 
Amb sa veu melindrosa 
Els a celletes cantant  
A festejarlo van 
Amb sa veu melindrosa. 
L'ocell rei d'espai  
Va pels aires volant 
Cantant amb melodia 
Dient:  Jesus es nat 
Per treure'ns del pecat  
I darnos alegria 
Dient:  Jesus es nat  
Per treure'ns del pacat  
I darnos alegria.  
Respont-il el pardal: 
Esta nit es Nadal  
I es nit de gran contento  
El verdum i el lluer  
Diuen, cantant tambe: 
O, quina alegria sento 
El verdum i el lluer  
Diuen, cantant tambe:   
O, quina alegria sento.  
Cantava la perdiu:  
Me'n vaig a fer el niu  
Dins d'aguella establiam   
Per voure l'Infant 
Com esta tremolant  
En bracos de Maria 
Per voure L'Infant 
En bracos de Maria.

Caroling, caroling, now we go 
Christmas bells are ringing 
Caroling, caroling through the snow 
Christmas bells are ringing.
Joyous voices sweet and clear   
Sing the sad of heart to cheer   
Ding dong, ding dong   
Christmas bells are ringing.
Caroling, caroling through the town   
Christmas bells are ringing   
Caroling, caroling up and down  
Christmas bells are ringing.
Mark ye well the song we sing   
Gladsome tidings now we bring   
Ding dong, ding dong   
Christmas bells are ringing! 
Caroling, caroling, near and far   
Christmas bells are ringing   
Following, following yonder star   
Christmas bells are ringing.
Sing we all this happy morn   
"Lo, the King of heaven is born!"   
Ding dong, ding dong   
Christmas bells are ringing.

It's time I found myself 
Totally surrounded in your circles 
Whoa, my friends.
Please celebrate me home 
Give me a number

And I can recall 
Whenever I find myself too all alone 
I can sing me home.
Uneasy highway 
Traveling where the Westerly winds can fly 
Somebody tried to tell me 
But the men forgot to tell me why.
I gotta count on being gone 
Come on woman, come on daddy 
Be what you want from me 
I'm this strong, I'll be weak.
Please celebrate me home 
Give me a number 
Please celebrate me home 
Play me one more song 
That I'll always remember 
I can recall 
Whenever I find myself too all alone 
I can make believe I've never gone 
I never know where I belong 
Sing me home.

Joseph was an old man  
An old man was he  
He wedded Virgin Mary  
The Queen of Galilee  
The Queen of Galilee.
As Joseph and Mary  
Walked through an orchard green  
There were apples and cherries  
Plenty to be seen.
Mary spoke to Joseph  
So meek and so mild  
"Joseph, gather me some cherries  
For I am with child."
Then Joseph flew in anger  
In anger he flew  
"Let the father of the baby  
Gather cherries for you."
Jesus spoke a few words  
And a very few words spoke he  
"My mother wants some cherries  
Bend over, cherry tree!"
The cherry tree bowed down  
It was low to the ground  
And Mary gathered cherries  
While Joseph stood around.
Then Joseph took Mary  
All on his left knee  
Saying," Lord have mercy upon me  
For what I have done."
Then Joseph took Mary  
All on his right knee  
"Pray tell me, little baby  
When your birthday shall be?"
"On the sixth day of January  
My birthday shall be  
When the stars and the elements  
Shall tremble with fear."

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose 
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir 
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe 
Help to make the season bright 
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow 
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.
They know that Santa's on his way 
He's bringing lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh 
And every mother's child is gonna spy 
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.
And so I'm offering this simple phrase 
To kids from one to ninety-two 
Although it's been said many times, many ways 
Merry Christmas to you.

All of Santa's reindeer pull his sleigh  
And that's their claim to fame  
But in Santa's house   
There lives a little mouse  
And Chrissy is her name. 
Oh Chrissy, the Christmas mouse  
Lives in the middle of Santa's house  
And all day long she would romp and play   
And help Santa load his Christmas sleigh. 
Now the story goes that Chrissy's nose   
Was also big and bright   
But we all know she did not go  
On that famous ride that night. 
Christmas day found her sad and blue  
And Santa said, "What's wrong with you?"   
She said, "I'm here all alone each day  
While you're out riding in your Christmas sleigh." 
Oh Chrissy, the Christmas mouse  
Lives in the middle of Santa's house   
And all day long she would romp and play   
And help Santa load his Christmas sleigh. 
Now every day she would beg and plead  
With Santa and his wife  
"Oh Santa, Santa", Chrissy said  
"Please let me ride upon your Christmas sled." 
And Santa said to Mrs. Claus   
"Did Chrissy finish all her chores?"   
"She cleaned her room, and made her bed  
Please let her ride in your Christmas sled." 
Oh Chrissy, the Christmas mouse  
Lives in the middle of Santa's house  
And all day long she would romp and play  
And help Santa load his Christmas sleigh. 
Now on Christmas eve when the moon is high  
And the children are all in bed  
Just look above and see our love  
Riding in Santa's sled. 
Oh Chrissy, the Christmas mouse  
Lives in the middle of Santa's house  
She's so happy on Christmas day  
Because she rides on Santa's sleigh.
"Merry Christmas everybody!"   
"Merry Christmas!" "Yeah!"

Christ, by highest heaven adored  
Christ, the everlasting lord  
Late in time behold him come  
Offspring of a virgin's womb.  
Veiled in flesh the godhead see  
Hail the incarnate deity  
Pleased as man with man to dwell  
Jesus, our Emmanuel.
Come, desire of nations come  
Fix in us thy humble home  
Rise, the woman's conquering seed  
Bruise in us the serpent's head.  
Adam's likeness, Lord efface  
Stamp thy image in its place  
Second Adam, from above  
Reinstate us in thy love.
Hail, the heaven born Prince of peace!  
Hail, the son of righteousness!  
Light and life to all he brings  
Ris'n with healing in his wings.  
Mild he lays his glory by  
Born that man no more may die  
Born to raise the sons of earth.

Wreathe the holly, twine the hay; 
Christus natus hodie; 
The Babe, The Son, the Holy One of Mary.
He is born to set us free, 
He is born our Lord to be, 
Ex Maria Virgine,

Ex Maria Virgine; 
The God, the Lord, by all ador'd forever.
Sing out with bliss, 
His name is this: Immanuel! 
As twas foretold in days of old, 
By Gabriel.


Christians, awake, salute the happy morn  
Whereon the Savior of the world was born  
Rise to adore the mystery of love 
Which hosts of angels chanted from above 
With them the joyful tidings first begun 
Of God Incarnate and the Virgin's Son.
Then to the watchful shepherds it was told 
Who heard the angelic herald's voice, "Behold, 
I bring good tidings of a Savior's birth 
To you and all the nations upon the earth 
This day hath God fulfilled His promised Word 
This day is born a Savior, Christ the Lord."
He spake and straightaway the celestial choir 
In hymns of joy, unknown before, conspire 
The praises of redeeming love they sang 
And heaven's whole orb with alleluias rang 
God's highest glory was their anthem still 
Peace upon earth and unto men good will.
To Bethlehem straight the enlightened shepherds ran 
To see the wonder God had wrought for man 
And found, with Joseph and the blessed maid 
Her Son, the Savior, in a manger laid 
Then to their flocks, still praising God, return 
And their glad hearts with holy rapture burn.
Oh, may we keep and ponder in our mind 
God's wondrous love in saving lost mankind! 
Trace we the Babe, who hath retrieved our loss 
From His poor manger to His bitter cross 
Tread in His steps, assisted by His grace 
Till man's first heavenly state again takes place.
Then may we hope, the angelic hosts among 
To sing, redeemed, a glad triumphal song 
He that was born upon this joyful day 
Around us all His glory shall display 
Saved by His love, incessant we shall sing 
Eternal praise to heaven's almighty King.

Everybody's singin'

Two Fender Bassmans

And a xylophone.

Telling of a Child in a manger who is born 
He is the King of kings. 
King of glory, hope for our nations 
Sent to earth to save and redeem 
Prince of peace, behold and adore 
The Son of God has come to set us free.

She said, "You know the cotton crop hasn't been too good this year  
There's no spending money, and well, at least we're all here 
I hope you won't expect a lot of Christmas presents  
Just be thankful that there is plenty to eat  
That's a blessing that'll make things a little more pleasant".
And us kids got to thinking how really blessed we were  
At least we were all healthy and best of all, we had her.
Roy cut down a pig apple tree  
And we dragged it home, Jack and me  
Daddy killed a squirrel and Louise made the bread  
Reba decorated the tree with popcorn strings  
Before we went to bed.
Mama and daddy sacrificed 
Cause this Christmas was lean  
But after all, there was the babies, Tom and Joanne 
Babies need a few things.
I whittled a whistle for my brother Jack  
And though we fought now and then  
When I gave Jack that whistle 
He knew I thought the world of him.
Mama made the girl's dresses out of flour sacks  
And when she ironed them down 
You couldn't tell that they hadn't come from town.
A sharecropper's family across the road 
Didn't have it as good as us  
They didn't even have a light and it was way past dusk.
And mama said, "Well, I bet they don't even have coal or beans to boil  
A log, apples oranges and such".  
Me and Jack took a jar of coal, and some hickor' nuts we'd found  
We walked to the sharecropper's porch and set 'em down. 
A poor old ragged lady eased open the door  
She picked up the coal and hickor' nuts and said,  
"I sure do thank ye", and quickly closed the door.
We started back home, me and Jack  
And about halfway, we stopped and looked back  
And in the sharecropper's window, at last was a light  
So, for one of the neighbors and for us  
It was a good Christmas night.
Christmas came and Christmas went  
Christmas that year was heaven sent  
Then daddy put on his gumboots  
Waited for the thaw back home in Dyess, Arkansas.

The sleigh bells are ringing  
And the carolers are singing 
While the air raid sirens blare.
It's Christmas at ground zero 
The button has been pressed 
The radio just let us know  
That this is not a test.
Everywhere the atom bombs are dropping 
It's the end of all humanity 
No more time for last-minute shopping 
It's time to face your final destiny.
It's Christmas at ground zero 
There's panic in the crowd 
We can dodge debris while we trim the tree 
Underneath the mushroom cloud.
Ronald Reagan: 
Well, the big day is only a few hours away now 
I'm sure you're all looking forward to it  
As much as we are.
You might hear some reindeer on your rooftop 
Or Jack Frost on your windowsill 
But if someone's climbing down your chimney 
You better load your gun and shoot to kill.
It's Christmas at ground zero 
And if the radiation level is okay 
I'll go out with you and see  
All the new mutations on New Year's Day. 
It's Christmas at ground zero 
Just seconds left to go 
I'll duck and cover with my Yuletide lover 
Underneath the mistletoe. 
It's Christmas at ground zero 
Now the missiles are on their way 
What a crazy fluke  
We're gonna get nuked 
On this jolly holiday.
What a crazy fluke  
We're gonna get nuked 
On this jolly holiday.

Bring out the old cheer  
Ring in the new year  
And get that Christmas feeling. 
I wish you joy that never ends  
Happy times with all your friends 
Come on and hold my hips a little longer 
As we do the Christmas Conga. 
Bonga, bonga, bonga, bonga  
Do the Christmas Conga  
Bonga, bonga, bonga, bonga  
Do the Christmas Conga. 
The old white tree still looks good 
And Grandma's angels got me thinking 
String up the new lights 
Brighten the cold nights 
And get those baubles blinking. 
I wish you joy that never ends  
Happy times with all your friends 
Come on and hold my hips a little longer 
As we do the Christmas Conga. 
Bonga, bonga, bonga, bonga  
Do the Christmas Conga  
Bonga, bonga, bonga, bonga  
Do the Christmas Conga. 
And then we'll put on party hats  
As the year comes to a conclusion 
Turn on the yule log  
Spike up the egg nog  
And break those resolutions. 
I wish you joy that never ends  
Happy times with all your friends 
Come on and hold my hips a little longer 
As we do the Christmas Conga. 
Bonga, bonga, bonga, bonga  
Do the Christmas Conga  
Bonga, bonga, bonga, bonga  
Do the Christmas Conga. 
I wish you joy that never ends  
Happy times with all your friends 
Come on and hold my hips a little longer 
As we do the Christmas Conga. 
Bonga, bonga, bonga, bonga  
Do the Christmas Conga  
Bonga, bonga, bonga, bonga  
Do the Christmas Conga. 

And Christmas tree, happiness. 
Christmas Day is all that it should be  
Lights and carols and holly  
And all kinds of loveliness.
Christmas bells ringing out  
Goodwill to men and peace on earth  
Everything they taught you 
When you were a child  
The things a Child  
Once taught the world.
If Christmas day is really in your heart  
You don't have to save up 
All your love to give once a year  
Learn to give, try to live  
Each day like Christmas Day.

On a snow blue winter's day.
He asked to drink by our fire 
And I was pleased to let him stay 
He drank there quietly for a while.
Then he turned and said to me 
"Your eyes are green like summer grass 
Your lips are red like a fresh cut rose 
Your hair is soft like an Irish stream 
And your voice is filled with sweet beauty".
And the last words I heard him say 
Were, "I shall return for you my love 
On Christmas Day".
The night will come, but I won't sleep 
As I watch the stars that lead him 
I cannot place where he is 
But still my heart goes with him.
I'm savin' all my Sunday clothes 
For the day that I'll be leavin' 
Father knows, my sister knows 
And my friends, they're happy for me 
And the priest he says 
"You should thank God 
For the blessing of such beauty".
And the last words I heard him say 
Were, "I shall return, for you, my love 
On Christmas day".
"I shall return for you, my love 
On Christmas day".
And the last words I heard him say 
Were the last words I ever heard him say 
"I shall return for you, my love 
On Christmas day".
"I swear, I will return 
On Christmas day 
And yes, I shall return 
On Christmas day".
"I shall return for you 
On Christmas day 
My love, I will return 
On Christmas day".
"I shall return, my love 
On Christmas day 
On Christmas day".

And it came to pass on a Christmas evening  
While all the doors were shuttered tight 
Outside standing, lonely boy child 
Cold and shivering in the night.
On the street, every window 
Save but one, was gleaming bright 
And to this window walked the boy child 
Peeking in saw, candle light.
Through other windows he had looked at turkeys 
Ducks and geese, cherry pies 
But through this window saw a gray haired lady 
Table bare and tears in her eyes.
Into his coat reached the boy child 
Knowing well there was little there 
He took from his pocket 
His own Christmas dinner 
A bit of cheese, some bread to share.
His outstretched hands 
Held the food and they trembled 
As the door, it opened wide 
Said he, "Would you share with me Christmas dinner?" 
Gently said she, "Come inside".
The gray haired lady brought forth to the table 
Glasses two and her last drop of wine 
Said she, "Here's a toast to everyone's Christmas 
And especially yours and mine".
And it came to pass on that Christmas evening 
While all the doors were shuttered tight 
That in that town, the happiest Christmas 
Was shared by candle light.

All I need is a little snow  
Starts me off, sets the theme  
Helps me dream my Christmas dream  
Every year I dream it  
Hoping things will change 
An end to the crying, the shouting, the dying  
And I hope you will dream it too  
It's Christmas, remember?   
We've got to remember! 
So, light the light, I'm home tonight  
I need you to warm me, to calm me, to love me  
To help me to dream my Christmas dream! 
Crazy things, said n'done  
Every single day but one  
Every night should I believe  
Be the same as Christmas Eve? 
Nights should all be silent 
Days should all slow down  
An end to the hurry, the noise and the worry  
And I hope you believe that too   
It's Christmas, remember?  
Does no one remember?   
The whole world needs  
A Christmas dream 
We need it to warm us, to calm us, to love us  
To help us to dream our Christmas dream! 
The whole world needs a Christmas dream 
We need it to warm us, to calm us, to love us  
We need it to warm us, to calm us, to love us  
We need it to warm us, to calm us, to love us  
We need it to warm us, to calm us, to love us  
To help us to dream our Christmas dream.

No sign of snow around; 
And yet I go around hearing  
Jingle bells ringing  
In my ear.
Your promise must be the reason 
The happy season  
Is here; 
So, I'm doing my Christmas dreaming 
A little early  
This year.
Your promise must be the reason 
The happy season  
Is here; 
So, I'm doing my Christmas dreaming 
A little early  
This year.

And in my heart there is no doubt 
That this is going to be 
The brightest holiday 
'Cause here you are with me 
Baby, baby, I can't wait.
Ooooh yeah yeah yeah!
To spend this special time of year 
With someone who makes me feel  
The special way that you do. 
Ooooh yeah yeah yeah!
Walking with you in a winter's snow 
Kissing underneath the mistletoe 
People smiling everywhere we go 
It's Christmas Eve  
And they can see we're in love.
Ooh, you make the season bright 
With the lights reflecting in your eyes 
All my dreams are coming true tonight 
It's Christmas Eve  
And I can see we're in love.
We'll stay up late tonight 
Decorate the tree 
Just look into my eyes 
And I will tell you truthfully 
That I don't need no Santa Claus 
To hear my Christmas wish 
I got you in my arms 
And what could be a better gift 
Than to spend my very favorite time of year 
With the one I really love, so near.
Ooooh yeah yeah yeah!
Walking with you in a winter's snow 
Kissing underneath the mistletoe 
People smiling everywhere we go 
It's Christmas Eve  
And they can see we're in love.
Oooh!
Ooh, you make the season bright 
With the lights reflecting in your eyes 
All my dreams are coming true tonight 
It's Christmas Eve  
And I can see we're in love.
And the bells are ringing  
When I hear you say 
"We'll do it all again  
On Christmas Day"
I can't wait!
Walking with you in a winter's snow 
Kissing underneath the mistletoe 
People smiling everywhere we go 
It's Christmas Eve  
And they can see we're in love.
Ooh, you make the season bright 
With the lights reflecting in your eyes 
All my dreams are coming true tonight 
It's Christmas Eve  
And I can see we're in love.
Walking with you in a winter's snow 
Kissing underneath the mistletoe 
People smiling everywhere we go 
It's Christmas Eve  
And they can see we're in love.
Ooh, you make the season bright 
With the lights reflecting in your eyes 
All my dreams are coming true tonight 
It's Christmas Eve  
And I can see we're in love.

I stuck my hands down deep inside my coat 
I think of years ago 
And half remembered Christmas trees 
And faces that still warm me with their glow.
The cold and empty evening  
Hangs around me like a ghost 
I listen to my footsteps in the snow 
The sound of one man walkin' through the snow  
Can break your heart 
But stopping doesn't help, so on I'll go.
And Christmas eve can kill you 
When you're trying to hitch a ride to anywhere.
The icy air I'm breathin'  
Is all that keeps me on my feet 
I feel like I've been walking all my life 
A car goes running by  
The man don't even turn his head 
Guess he's busy being Santa Claus tonight.
The saddest part of all  
Is knowing if I switched with him 
I'd leave him stumblin' ragged by the road 
I'd ride that highway to the arms of my sweet family 
And forget about the stranger in the cold.
And Christmas eve can kill you 
When you're trying to hitch a ride to anywhere.
And as I walk I'm singin' to myself  
Oh silent night 
Hoping I can save those other souls 
Oh, God forgive the man  
Who drives right by the other man 
Have pity on the stranger in the cold.
'Cause Christmas Eve can kill you 
When you're trying to hitch a ride to anywhere.

All of the good gifts given today 
Ours is the sky and the wide open range.
Back in the cities, they have different ways 
Football and eggnog and Christmas parades 
I'll take the saddle, I'll take the reins 
It's Christmas for cowboys and wide open plains.
A campfire for warmth as we stop for the night 
The stars overhead are the Christmas tree lights 
The wind sings a hymn as we bow down to pray 
It's Christmas for cowboys and the wide open plains.
Tall in the saddle we spend Christmas Day 
Driving the cattle on the snow-covered plains. 
So many gifts have been opened today 
Ours is the sky and the wide open range. 
It's Christmas for cowboys and wide open plains.

And they found his shop so meager and mean 
Made gay with a thousand boughs of green.
And Conrad was sitting with face a-shine 
When he suddenly stopped as he stitched a twine 
And he said, "Old friends, at dawn today 
When the cock was crowing the night away 
The Lord appeared in a dream to me 
And said, 'I am coming your guest to be.'
"So I've been busy with feet astir 
Strewing my shop with branches of fir 
The table is spread and the kettle is shined 
And over the rafters the holly is twined."
"And now I will wait for my Lord to appear 
And listen closely so I will hear 
His step as He nears my humble place 
And I open the door and look on His face."
So his friends went home and left Conrad alone 
For this was the happiest day he had known 
For, long since, his family had passed away 
And Conrad had spent many a sad Christmas day.
But he knew with the Lord as his Christmas guest 
This Christmas would be the dearest and best 
So he listened with only joy in his heart 
And with every sound he would rise with a start 
And look for the Lord to be at his door 
Like the vision he had a few hours before.
So, he ran to the window after hearing a sound 
But all that he could see on the snow-covered ground 
Was a shabby beggar whose shoes were torn 
And all of his clothes were ragged and worn.
But Conrad was touched and went to the door 
And he said, "Your feet must be frozen and sore 
I have some shoes in my shop for you 
And a coat that will keep you warmer, too."
So with grateful heart the man went away 
But Conrad noticed the time of day 
He wondered what made the Lord so late 
And how much longer he'd have to wait.
When he heard a knock and ran to the door 
But it was only a stranger once more 
A bent, old lady with a shawl of black 
With a bundle of kindling piled on her back.
She asked for only a place to rest 
But that was reserved for Conrad's Great Guest 
But her voice seemed to plead, "Don't send me away 
Let me rest for awhile on Christmas day."
So Conrad brewed her a steaming cup 
And told her to sit at the table and sup 
But after she left he was filled with dismay 
For he saw that the hours were slipping away 
And the Lord had not come as He said He would 
And Conrad felt sure he had misunderstood.
When out of the stillness he heard a cry 
"Please help me and tell me where am I." 
So again he opened his friendly door 
And stood disappointed as twice before 
It was only a child who had wandered away 
And was lost from her family on Christmas Day.
Again Conrad's heart was heavy and sad 
But he knew he should make the little girl glad 
So he called her in and wiped her tears 
And quieted all her childish fears.
Then he led her back to her home once more 
But as he entered his own darkened door 
He knew that the Lord was not coming today 
For the hours of Christmas had passed away.
So he went to his room and knelt down to pray 
And he said, "Dear Lord, why did you delay 
What kept You from coming to call on me? 
For I wanted so much Your face to see."
When soft in the silence a voice he heard 
"Lift up your head for I kept My word 
Three times My shadow crossed your floor 
Three times I came to your lowly door.
For I was the beggar with bruised, cold feet 
I was the woman you gave something to eat 
And I was the child on the homeless street.
Three times I knocked and three times I came in 
And each time I found the warmth of a friend 
Of all the gifts, love is the best 
I was honored to be your Christmas Guest."

By now in New York City  
There's snow on the ground 
And out in California  
The sunshines' falling down  
And maybe down in Memphis  
Graceland's all in lights  
And in Atlanta, Georgia  
There's peace on Earth tonight.
Christmas in Dixie, its snowing in the pines  
Merry Christmas from Dixie to everyone tonight.
Its windy in Chicago  
The kids are out of school;  
There's magic in Motown  
The city's on the move.  
In Jackson, Mississippi to Charlotte, Caroline.  
And all across the Nation, its a peaceful Christmas time.
Christmas in Dixie, its snowing in the pines  
Merry Christmas from Dixie, to everyone tonight.
And from Fort Payne, Alabama  
Merry Christmas tonight.

I approached very slowly with my heart full of fear  
Looked at his dog, oh my God, an ill reindeer  
But then I was willin' because the man had a beard  
And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared  
So, I turned my head a second and the man had gone  
But he must have dropped his wallet smack down on the lawn.
I picked the wallet up, then I took a pause  
Took out the license and it cold said "Santa Claus"  
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's  
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease  
But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right  
So I was going home to mail it back to him that night  
But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree  
Was a letter from Santa and the dough's for me.
It's Christmas time in Hollis Queens  
Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens  
Rice and stuffin', macaroni and cheese  
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees  
Decorate the house with lights at night  
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright  
In the fireplace is the yule log  
Beneath the mistletoe as we drink eggnog  
The rhymes that you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's  
But each and every year we bust Christmas carols.
Rhymes so loud and proud you hear it  
It's Christmas time and we got the spirit  
Jack Frost chillin', the orchids out  
And that's what Christmas is all about  
The time is now, the place is here  
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer.
My name's D.M.C. with the mike in my hand  
And I'm chilling and coolin' just like a snowman  
So open your eyes, lend us an ear  
We want to say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Santa's back up in the hood 
So meet me under the mistletoe  
Lets fuck! 
It's Chanukah in Inglewood 
The dreidel's spinning in the hood 
So meet me by the menorah 
Lets get drunk.
Ho ho ho!
Merry Christmas

Chorus:  
It's Christmas in Hollywood 
Santa's back up in the hood 
So meet me under the mistletoe  
Lets fuck! 
It's Chanukah in Inglewood 
The driedel's spinning in the hood 
So meet me by the menorah 
Lets get drunk.
Ju Ju Ju Just a little story about last Christmas  
About some bad kids who were full of wishes 
We gave some gifts and then we gave some lovin' 
The weird kind of love, that you give to your cousin 
Little Timmy stole from 7-11 
So, we stopped by his house with a pair of sevens 
We drank in his room with some dude named Kevin 
But, there was still some bad kids who deserved some presents 
Zack got caught with a bottle of Jack 
So we slipped down his chimney with an 18 pack 
He didn't leave cookies but we needed a snack 
So, we took the beer back and I fucked him in the ass!!! 
It's Charlie Scene, got eggnog in my flask 
The holidays are back and all my presents are wrapped 
Like Oh My God! Is that Saint Nick? 
Kids give me your list, like it's the 25th 
Been accused of being a bad kid 
But I get presents as it is 
Cause Mrs.Claus just MySpace'd me 
I blew off a date on Christmas eve 
So, I don't give a fuck if you're naughty or nice 
You might still get a Rolly and a gang on ice 
So write your list and never have no fear 
Have a Hollywood Christmas  
And an Undead New Year!!!!
Fuck Yeah!!
Watch your language 
Ho ho ho
'Bout to serve it up for all you boys and girls 
Good kids, bad and even Da Kurlzz 
We were chillin' at home and deckin' the halls 
So I checked my phone and Santa had called 
He said he'd swing by at a quarter to twelve 
He said that his jolly ass needed some help 
He said, "Christmas ain't a gang but a way of life 
If you guide my sleigh, I'll let you fuck my wife." 
So we jumped in his sleigh and it started to jingle 
Funnier than fuck, you can ask Kris Kringle 
So we all took flight but something was fishy 
He asked for road head and started to kiss me 
Underneath his suit was just a bunch of pillows 
Instead of bags of presents, he had bags of dildos 
I pulled down his beard and it was a monster 
It wasn't Saint Nick it was a fuckin' imposter.
When we found out, he started to pout 
I took my bandana and I choked him out 
I pulled off his beard and I fucked his mouth 
Hijacked his sleigh and headed down south 
I had a lot of wild nights, but tonight was the craziest 
Met a lot of Jeffs, but this one was the shadiest 
When it comes to cheer, that motherfucker's a grinch 
So, if you don't like Christmas, fuck you bitch!!!
You kids are in big trouble 
Oh boy 
Ho ho! 
Looks like Santa had a little too much eggnog.
Chorus:  
It's Christmas in Hollywood 
Santa's back up in the hood 
So meet me under the mistletoe  
Lets fuck! 
It's Chanukah in Inglewood 
The dreidel's spinning in the hood 
So meet me by the menorah 
Lets get drunk.

Lets get drunk 
Ho ho yeah.
Lets get drunk.
Chorus:  
It's Christmas in Hollywood 
Santa's back up in the hood 
So meet me under the mistletoe  
Lets fuck! 
It's Chanukah in Inglewood 
The dreidel's spinning in the hood 
So meet me by the menorah 
Lets get drunk 
Lets get drunk.
Chorus:  
It's Christmas in Hollywood 
Santa's back up in the hood 
So meet me under the mistletoe  
Lets fuck! 
It's Chanukah in Inglewood 
The driedel's spinning in the hood 
So meet me by the menorah 
Lets get drunk.

Had a little too much to drink     
Ain't got no bail     
Ain't got no bail  
And spendin' New Year's Eve in the clink. 
I was in the wrong lane  
Feelin' no pain   
Zoomed my car to seventy-five 
Ran right into 
You can guess who  
And say I'm lucky to be alive. 
Merry Christmas!  
Happy New Year! 
They're singin' down the street  
While everybody's havin' Christmas turkey  
They give me bread and water to eat. 
Christmas in jail  
Christmas in jail  
Wore my shoes out pacin' the floor 
Got rocks in my head   
I wish I was dead  
Ain't gonna drink and drive no more. 
Merry Christmas!  
Happy New Year! 
They're singin' down the street  
While everybody's havin' Christmas turkey  
They give me bread and water to eat. 
Christmas in jail  
Christmas in jail  
Wore my shoes out pacin' the floor 
Got rocks in my head   
I wish I was dead  
Ain't gonna drink and drive no more 
Ain't gonna drink and drive no more 
Ain't gonna drink and drive no more. 
Merry Christmas! 
Hic! Hic! Hic!   

Christmas in Jamaica  
Here we come   
We'll just sail on   
Just sail. 
Lovers frolickin'   
Playin' in the sand   
Got my Coppertone   
Getting on my tan.
Exotic setting   
For a lady   
And her man   
A perfect little holiday   
Sounds like a plan. 
We can stay in bed all afternoon  
We can make out to some cool Reggae tunes  
We can sail under the light of the moon   
Wish we could freeze this moment  
Then it wouldn't end so soon. 
We'll be having fun    
Under the golden sun    
Christmas in Jamaica   
Here we come    
We'll just sail on   
Just sail. 
Unplug the phones, y'all  
Don't need no calls   
No callin' home   
Take a break from it all. 
'Cause we both grown    
And we can do whatever, see?   
Baby, it's just you and me   
Let's live out a fantasy.
Hiking in the mountains, romantic rendezvous  
Bathing in the fountains, stop; let me look at you   
Just in case you're doubtin', let me paint a view    
Picture you're in heaven, everything is true. 
We'll be having fun   
Under the golden sun   
Christmas in Jamaica   
Here we come  
We'll just sail on  
Just sail.

The holly green, the ivy green  
The prettiest picture you've ever seen 
Is Christmas in Killarney 
With all of the folks at home.
It's nice, you know, to kiss your beau 
While cuddling under the mistletoe 
And Santa Claus you know, of course 
Is one of the boys from home.
The door is always open 
The neighbors pay a call 
And Father John before he's gone 
Will bless the house and all.
How grand it feels to click your heels 
And join in the fun of the jigs and reels 
I'm handing you no blarney 
The likes you've never known 
Is Christmas in Killarney 
With all of the folks at home.

I tried to hide my feelings  
To keep myself controlled 
But somehow I can't deny  What's deep inside my soul.
I've been always on the run 
So many different places, having fun 
But like a river always knows just where to flow 
Now that December comes, I feel like coming home.
It's Christmas in my heart 
When I'm with you 
No matter where we are or what we do.
Tomorrow may be gray 
We may be torn apart 
But if you stay tonight 
It's Christmas in my heart.
I don't know how to stay alive 
Without your touch, without you by my side 
Just like the desert's always waiting for the rain 
Oh baby, I wish the holy night would come again.
It's Christmas in my heart 
When I'm with you 
No matter where we are or what we do.
Everywhere I go and everyone I know 
Is making lots of wishes for old Santa Claus 
But all I really need tonight 
Is for you to come and hold me tight 
What is Christmas without you here by my side 
I need you tonight.

I remember the child in the manger  
As he sleeps.
Wherever there are people 
Giving gifts, exchanging cards 
I believe that Christmas 
Is truly in our hearts.
Let's light our Christmas trees  
For a bright tomorrow 
Where nations are at peace  
And all are one in God.
Chorus: 
Let's sing Merry Christmas 
And a happy holiday 
This season may we never forget  
The love we have for Jesus 
Let him be the one to guide us  
As another new year starts 
And may the spirit of Christmas 
Be always in our hearts.
In every prayer and every song 
The community unites  
Celebrating the birth of our savior  
Jesus Christ. 
Let love like that starlight  
On that first Christmas morn 
Lead us back to the manger  
Where Christ the child was born.
So, come let us rejoice 
Come and sing the Christmas carols 
With one big joyful voice 
Proclaim the name of the Lord.
Chorus: 
Let's sing Merry Christmas 
And a happy holiday 
This season may we never forget  
The love we have for Jesus 
Let him be the one to guide us  
As another new year starts 
And may the spirit of Christmas  
Be always in our hearts.
Chorus: 
Let's sing Merry Christmas 
And a happy holiday 
This season may we never forget  
The love we have for Jesus 
Let him be the one to guide us  
As another new year starts 
And may the spirit of Christmas  
Be always in our hearts.

We had turkey and pistols 
Carved out of wood.
And I dream of her always 
Even when I don't dream 
Her name's on my tongue 
And her blood in my stream.
Wait a while  
Eternity  
Old Mother Nature's 
Got nothing on me 
Come to me  
Run to me 
Come to me now 
We're rolling  
My sweetheart 
We're flowing 
By God! 
She reminds me of a chess game 
With someone I admire 
Or a picnic in the rain 
After a prairie fire.
Her heart is as big 
As this whole goddamn jail 
She's sweeter than saccharine 
At a drug store sale.
Wait a while  
Wait a while  
Eternity  
Old Mother Nature's 
Got nothing on me 
Come to me  
Run to me 
Come to me now 
We're rolling  
My sweetheart 
We're flowing 
By God! 
The searchlight in the big yard  
Goes round with the gun  
And spotlights the snowflakes   
Like dust in the sun.
It's Christmas in prison  
And there'll be music tonight  
I'll probably get homesick  
I love you 
Goodnight. 
Wait a while  
Eternity  
Old Mother Nature's 
Got nothing on me 
Come to me  
Run to me 
Come to me now 
We're rolling  
My sweetheart 
We're flowing 
By God! 

When it's Christmas time in Texas  
It's a very special time for me  
In Texas we'll be swingin' 'round the Christmas tree  
Dancin' to a Christmas melody.
When it's Christmas time in Texas  
It might look just like a Summer day  
There may not be snow in San Antonio  
But it's a Texas Christmas to me.
When Santa crosses over the border  
He'll sound a little diff'rent when he sings  
He'll hear those twin fiddles playin'  
Christmas songs with a touch of western swing  
There may not be snow in San Antonio  
But it's a Texas Christmas to me.
When it's Christmas time in Texas  
I love to hear those Christmas carolers sing  
People on the go, children's faces all aglow  
Wond'rin' what Santa's gonna bring.
Grandpa's been chasin' Grandma around  
Tryin' to catch her 'neath the mistletoe  
Everything is right, the Lone Star's shinin' bright  
And it's a Texas Christmas to me.
When Santa crosses over the border  
He'll sound a little diff'rent when he sings  
He'll hear those twin fiddles playin'  
Christmas songs with a touch of western swing  
There may not be snow in San Antonio  
But it's a Texas Christmas to me.
And we're wishing you all a Merry Christmas  
Merry Christmas from Texas and me.

Christmas is a time to love. 
Christmas is a time  
Christmas is a time   
Christmas is a time to love. 
Christmas is a time   
Christmas is a time  
Christmas is a time to love. 
Christmas is a time  
Christmas is a time  
Christmas is a time to love. 
We often start to worry  
And people get upset   
If things don't go alright on Christmas day. 
What we should remember   
In all the push and shove     
Is Christmas is a time to love. 
Christmas is a time   
Christmas is a time   
Christmas is a time to love.
Christmas is a time   
Christmas is a time  
Christmas is a time to love. 
Maybe things don't sound right   
Or look the way they should   
And maybe they're not perfectly in tune.
It really doesn't matter   
Lets keep our eyes above   
Cos' Christmas is a time to love. 
Christmas is a time   
Christmas is a time   
Christmas is a time to love.
Christmas is a time   
Christmas is a time  
Christmas is a time to love. 
Christmas is a time   
Christmas is a time   
Christmas is a time to love.
Christmas is a time   
Christmas is a time  
Christmas is a time to love. 

Christmas is coming  
The geese are getting fat  
Please put a penny  
In the old man's hat. 
If you haven't got a penny  
A ha'penny will do  
If you haven't got a ha'penny  
Then God bless you.
Christmas day is coming  
Lights are on the tree  
Hang up your stocking  
For Santa Claus to see.  
If you you haven't got a stocking  
A little sock will do  
If you haven't got a little sock  
Then God bless you!
Christmas day is coming  
The season of good cheer,  
Let's all sing a carol   
For the brand-new year!  
If you haven't got a carol  
A jolly song will do  
If you haven't got a jolly song  
Then God bless you!

Time for merry fun 
Yum tum tum hey! 
Come on an cheer 
Don't forget tell everyone 
Sing with Bearforce One 
Ting ting hurray!
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling 
Ring tingling too 
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride  
Together with you 
Outside the snow is falling 
And friends are calling "yoo hoo" 
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride  
Together with you.
You better watch out 
You better not cry 
You better not pout 
I'm tellin' you why 
Santa Claus is coming to town.
Sleigh bells ring 
Are you listenin'? 
In the lane 
Snow is glistenin' 
A beautiful sight 
We're happy tonight 
Walkin' in a winter wonderland.
Gone away  
Is the blue bird 
Here to stay is the new bird 
He sings a love song 
As we go along 
Walkin' in a winter wonderland.
We wish you a merry Christmas 
We wish you a merry Christmas 
We wish you a hairy Christmas 
And a happy 
Such a happy 
New year!

Don't forget tell everyone 
Sing with Bearforce One 
Ting-ting hurray! 
Have a merry ding dong day! 


Better write all your letters to Santa 
There's shopping and wrapping to do  
I bet you'll never believe it  
When you see what I got you  
You're gonna love it. 
Christmas is just around the corner  
Candles are glowing everywhere 
Can't wait until that night 
Reindeer appear 
Christmas   
And it's just about here. 
Christmas 
(Christmas) 
Is just around the corner 
(Is just around the corner) 
Christmas 
(Christmas) 
You feel it in the air  
(You feel it in the air) 
All the trees are surrounded with presents  
The stockings are fillin' up too 
I bet you'll never believe it 
When you see what I got you. 
What did you get me?
Christmas 
(Christmas) 
Is just around the corner 
(Is just around the corner) 
Sleigh bells 
(Sleigh bells) 
Are ringing in the square 
(Are ringing in the square) 
Too bad December comes 
Just once a year 
Christmas 
(Christmas) 
Time to trim the tree 
Christmas 
(Christmas) 
Can it really be?  
Christmas 
(Christmas) 
Yes, its finally here  
We've been waiting all year  
And it's finally here  
Yes, it's finally here   
Ooohhhhh  
It's finally here 
Christmas!

Christmas is the time to say "I love you" 
And a feeling that will last all through the year.
On the corner, carolers are singing 
There's a touch of magic in the air 
From grownup to minor, no one could be finer 
Times are hard but no one seems to care.
Christmas Eve and all the world is watching 
Santa guides his reindeer through the dark 
From rooftop to chimney, from Harlem to Bimini 
They will find a way into your heart.
Christmas is the time to say "I love you" 
Share the joys of laughter and good cheer 
Christmas is the time to say "I love you" 
And a feeling that will last all through the year.
Just outside the window, snow is falling 
But here beside the fire, we share the glow
Of moonlight and brandy, sweet talk and candy
Sentiments that everyone should know.
Memories of the year that lays behind us 
Wishes for the year that's yet to come 
And it stands to reason, that good friends in season 
Make you feel that life has just begun.
Christmas is the time to say "I love you" 
Share the joys of laughter and good cheer 
Christmas is the time to say "I love you" 
And a feeling that will last all through the year.
So, when spirits grow lighter 
And hopes are shining brighter 
Then you know that 
Christmas time is here.

Let's get away from sleigh bells, let's get away from snow  
Let's make a break some Christmas, Dear, I know the place to go   
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?   
How'd ya like to spend the holiday away across the sea?   
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?   
How'd ya like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree? 
How'd ya like to stay up late, like the islanders do?   
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe?   
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island   
You will never stray, for everyday   
Your Christmas dreams come true. 
How'd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do?   
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe?   
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island   
You will never stray, for everyday   
Your Christmas dreams come true   
On Christmas Island your dreams come true. 

Got all kinds of poison in 
Poison in my blood. 
I took my feet  
To Oxford Street  
Trying to right a wrong  
Just walk away  
Those windows say  
But I can't believe she's gone. 
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall 
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all. 
Up above candles on air flicker 
Oh they flicker and they float 
But I'm up here holding on  
To all those chandeliers of hope. 
Like some drunken Elvis singing   
I go singing out of tune        
Saying how I always loved you darling    
And I always will. 
Oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall   
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all. 
Still waiting for the snow to fall 
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all. 
Those Christmas lights 
Light up the street  
Down where the sea and city meet 
May all your troubles soon be gone 
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on. 
Those Christmas lights  
Light up the street  
Maybe they'll bring her back to me   
Then all my troubles will be gone 
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on. 
Oh Christmas lights  
Light up the street 
Light up the fireworks in me   
May all your troubles soon be gone   
Those Christmas lights keep shining on.

Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe 
What would happen if God never let it snow 
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie 
Tell me what would you find?
You'd see that today holds something special 
Something holy, not superficial 
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives 
It's something we all try to ignore 
And put a wreath up on your door 
So, here's something you should know that is for sure 
Christmas must be something more.
What if angels did not pay attention 
To all the things that we wished they would always do 
What if happiness came in a cardboard box 
Then I think there is something we all forgot 
What would happen if presents all went away 
Tell me what would you find?
You'd see that today holds something special 
Something holy, not superficial 
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives 
It's something we all try to ignore 
And put a wreath up on your door 
So, here's something you should know that is for sure 
Christmas must be something more.
We get so caught up in all of it 
Business and relationships 
Hundred mile an hour lives 
And it's this time of year 
And everybody's here 
It seems the last thing on your mind.
Is that the day holds something special 
Something holy, not superficial 
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives 
It's something we all try to ignore 
And put a wreath up on your door 
But here's something you should know that is for sure 
Christmas must be something 
Christmas must be something 
Christmas must be something more.
There's gotta be more 
There's gotta be more.

The wheels start turning, torches start burning 
And the whole wise men journey from the east. 
How a little baby boy bring the people so much joy? 
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light 
This must be Christmas, must be tonight. 
A shepherd on the hillside, where over my flock I bide 
On a cold winter night, a band of angels sing 
In a dream I heard a voice say, "Fear not, come rejoice 
It's the end of the beginning, praise the new born King". 
How a little baby boy bring the people so much joy? 
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light 
This must be Christmas, must be tonight. 
I saw it with my own eyes, written up in the skies 
But why a simple herdsmen such as I? 
And then it came to pass, He was born at last 
Right below the star that shines on high. 
How a little baby boy bring the people so much joy 
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light 
This must be Christmas, must be tonight. 
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light 
This must be Christmas, must be tonight. 
Be tonight, be tonight 
Be tonight, be tonight 
Be tonight, be tonight.

Three wise men seeking truth, they traveled from afar   
Hoping to find the Child from Heaven 
Falling on their knees  
They bow before the humble Prince of peace. 
We bring an offering of worship to our King  
No one on earth deserves the praises that we sing  
Jesus, may You receive the honor that You're due  
O Lord, I bring an offering to You. 
The sun cannot compare to the glory of Your love 
There is no shadow in Your presence 
No mortal man would dare to stand before Your throne 
Before the Holy One of Heaven, it's only by Your blood  
It's only through Your mercy, Lord I come. 
I bring an offering of worship to my King  
No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing  
Jesus, may You receive the honor that You're due 
O Lord, I bring an offering to You. 
I bring an offering of worship to my King  
No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing   
Jesus, may You receive the honor that You're due  
O Lord, I bring an offering to You. 
We bring an offering to You  
We are an offering to You  
An offering of praise we sing 
An offering to You. 
We are an offering to You, Jesus    
An offering of praise we sing  
An offering to You   
We are an offering, oh Lord. 
We are an offering of worship to our King  
No one on earth deserves the praises that we sing  
Jesus, may You receive the honor that You're due  
O Lord, we bring an offering to You  
O Lord, we bring an offering. 
Offering to You  
We bring an offering to You  
We are an offering to You.

Call us from far, call us from near 
Oh! play me your Christmas pipes.
Christmas bells, Christmas bells 
Over the hills and over the dells 
Ringing out bright, ringing out clear 
Oh! ring me your Christmas bells.
Christmas strings, Christmas strings 
Playing the peace that Christmas brings 
Fiddle and bow, gentle and low 
Oh! play me your Christmas strings.
Christmas pipes, Christmas pipes 
Calling us, calling on Christmas night 
Call us from far, call us from near 
Oh! play me your Christmas pipes.
Oh holy night, the stars are brightly shining 
It is the night of the Savior's birth.
Christmas choir, Christmas choir 
Christmas carols 'round Christmas fire 
Holy night, angels on high 
Round up your Christmas choir.
Christmas band, Christmas band 
You're waiting for me with your Christmas band 
Cymbal and drum, rattle and hum 
March out your Christmas band.
Good to be home to your Christmas band.
Christmas pipes, Christmas pipes 
Calling us, calling on Christmas night 
Call us from far, call us from near 
Play me your Christmas pipes.
Christmas pipes, Christmas pipes 
Calling us on Christmas night 
Call us from far, call us from near 
Oh! play me your Christmas pipes 
Play me your Christmas pipes. 
Good to be home  
Good to be home  
Good to be home to your Christmas pipes.
Christmas 
Christmas 
Christmas 
Christmas.
Good to be home to your Christmas pipes.

And so I wonder can it be 
Will every mile bring you to me? 
A promise made may still come true 
So I am waiting here for you 
If you don't come, what will I do? 
Who shall I tell my secrets to?
Christmas bells ring out their chimes 
I hear them echo through the night 
And moonlight shines upon the road 
And trembles on the falling snow.
I look into the midnight blue 
So many stars I never knew 
If you don't come, what will I do? 
Who shall I tell my secrets to?
I look into the midnight blue 
So many stars I never knew 
If you don't come, what will I do? 
Who shall I tell my secrets to?


Tryin' to buy that last gift or two  
Not really in the Christmas mood.  
Standing right in front of me was  
A little boy waiting anxiously  
Pacing 'round like little boys do  
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes.
His clothes were worn and old  
He was dirty from head to toe  
And when it came his time to pay  
I couldn't believe what I heard him say  
"Sir, I want to buy these shoes  
For my Mama, please  
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size  
Could you hurry, sir?  
Daddy says there's not much time  
You see she's been sick for quite a while  
And I know these shoes would make her smile  
And I want her to look beautiful  
If Mama meets Jesus tonight."
He counted pennies for what seemed like years  
Then the cashier said, "Son, there's not enough here"  
He searched his pockets frantically  
Then he turned and he looked at me  
He said, "Mama made Christmas good at our house  
Though most years she just did without  
Tell me Sir, what am I going to do?  
Somehow I've got to buy her these Christmas shoes."
So I laid the money down  
I just had to help him out  
I'll never forget the look on his face when  
He said "Mama's gonna look so great." 
"Sir, I want to buy these shoes  
For my Mama, please  
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size  
Could you hurry, sir  
Daddy says there's not much time  
You see she's been sick for quite a while  
And I know these shoes would make her smile  
And I want her to look beautiful  
If Mama meets Jesus tonight."
I knew I'd caught a glimpse of heaven's love  
As he thanked me and ran out  
I knew that God had sent that little boy  
To remind me just what Christmas is all about.

Where a mother laid her baby 
You'd do well to remember the things He later said 
When you're stuffing yourselves at the Christmas parties 
You'll laugh when I tell you to take a running jump 
You're missing the point I'm sure does not need making 
That Christmas spirit is not what you drink.
So, how can you laugh when your own mother's hungry? 
And how can you smile when the reasons for smiling are wrong? 
And if I messed up your thoughtless pleasures 
Remember, if you wish, this is just a Christmas song.
Hey Santa, pass us that bottle, will you?


Had to grow up and see the world 
Through different shades of doubt 
Give me one more chance to dream again 
One more chance to feel again 
Through your young heart 
If only for one day, let me try.
I wanna see Christmas through your eyes 
I want everything to be the way it used to be 
Back to being a child again thinking the world was mine 
I wanna see Christmas, Christmas through your eyes.
I see the rain
You see the rainbow hiding in the clouds 
Never afraid to let your love show 
Won't you show me how? 
Wanna learn how to believe again 
Find the innocence in me again 
Through your young heart 
Help me find a way, help me try.
I wanna see Christmas through your eyes 
I want everything to be the way it used to be 
Back to being a child again thinking the world was mine 
I wanna see Christmas, Christmas through your eyes.
I wanna see Christmas through your eyes 
I want everything to be the way it used to be 
Back to being a child again thinking the world was mine 
I wanna see Christmas, Christmas through your eyes.
I wanna see Christmas 
I wanna see Christmas 
I wanna see Christmas through your eyes 
I wanna see, I wanna see Christmas 
I wanna see, I wanna see Christmas 
I wanna see Christmas through your eyes 
I wanna see Christmas 
I want to see Christmas 
I wanna see Christmas through your eyes.

When I was young  
Every Christmas Eve   
I could not sleep    
Trying to catch that old St.Nick  
Leaving presents under my tree   
And every year I'd fall asleep     
Laying in my bed   
Dreaming of a million sugarplums  
Dancing in my head. 
Oh how much joy it is  
At Christmas time  
The spirit of giving is in our lives, oh  
Oh, how much joy it brings  
To see the ones you love   
This year's gonna be the best Christmas  
Because: 
There'll be family and Christmas cheer 
Peace and goodwill to all men                      
Everybody is home for Christmas   
Everybody is home   
Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe  
I want a white Christmas  
So let it snow   
Everybody is home for Christmas   
Everybody is home  
It's Christmas time.   
Friends come together   
As we decorate the tree   
This is the time of year 
To live in harmony, oh  
Angels watch over 
As we put the kids to sleep    
It's Christmas time 
And when they awake their smiling faces  
Make it all complete, oh   
This is the holiday you're with the family   
We put aside our differences and let it be, oh      
Oh, how much fun it is to give and to receive    
This time of year 
Love is all we need, oh!  
There'll be family and Christmas cheer    
Peace and goodwill to all men      
Everybody is home for Christmas     
Everybody is home  
Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe  
I want a white Christmas 
So, let it snow     
Everybody is home for Christmas     
Everybody is home 
It's Christmas time   
It's Christmas time! 
Fa la la la la    
Fa la la la la la la. 
Open your hearts now  
This is the time for us to give  
The world needs love now                
So live and let live   
Families all here   
The spirit is good cheer    
The sound of carolers    
Ringing sweet in my ear   
Everything is all fine  
You know why,     
It's Christmas time     
What?   
Oh, how much joy it is at Christmas time    
The spirit of giving is in our lives       
Oh, oh how much joy it brings        
To see the ones you love        
This year's gonna be the best Christmas  
Because:   
There'll be family and Christmas cheer    
Peace and goodwill to all men      
Everybody is home for Christmas         
Everybody is home     
Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe      
I want a white Christmas       
So let it snow      
Everybody is home for Christmas     
Everybody is home      
It's Christmas time!

Over mulled wine  
With you.
On the 25th day  
Of the 12th month  
The sleigh bells are in time  
Ringing true.
How we cling each Noel 
To that snowflakes 
And hope in hell  
That it won't end.
Don't let the bells end  
Christmas time 
Just let them ring  
In peace. 

Well, the weather is cruel  
And the season of Yule 
Warms the heart  
But it still hurts.

You've got your career  
Spent the best part of last year apart   
And it still hurts   
So, that's why I pray 
Each and every Christmas day 
That it won't end.
Don't let the bells end  
Christmas time 
Just let them ring  
In peace.
Christmas time  
Don't let the bells end   
Christmas time  
Don't let the bells end. 
Dust underneath the mistletoe leaves  
When you're not here  
You went away upon boxing day  
Now how the hell am I gonna make it 
Into the New Year? 
Christmas time  
Don't let the bells end   
Christmas time  
Don't let the bells end. 
Christmas time  
Don't let the bells end   
Christmas time 
Kust let them ring   
In peace.
Christmas time  
Don't let the bells end   
Christmas time  
Don't let the bells end. 


Christmas time is here  
Happiness and cheer  
Fun for all that children call  
Their favorite time of the year.
Snowflakes in the air  
Carols everywhere  
Olden times and ancient rhymes  
Of love and dreams to share.
Sleigh bells in the air  
Beauty everywhere  
Yuletide by the fireside  
And joyful memories there.
Christmas time is here  
We'll be drawing near  
Oh, that we could always see  
Such spirit through the year  
Oh, that we could always see  
Such spirit through the year.

We untangle pines  
And hung some memories. 
Suit and tie 
Places to be tonight 
Girl, you've gotta know I don't wanna go  
It's so toasty warm inside.
Baby, let's just light the fire 
But I got a new dress 
Doesn't look so safe to drive 
You bought me that necklace 
We won't know what we're missin'  
If we don't go out for Christmas tonight.

So much snow 
The wind you know is bound to blow  
And mess up your hair, make it very wet 
Let's don't go. 
It's too late 
Whatever would we say  
We shouldn't break our plans  
Let down our friends 
Baby you best behave.
Baby, let's just light the fire  
What about the city? 
Doesn't look so safe to drive  
But the drive's so pretty 
We won't know what we're missin'  
If we don't go out for Christmas tonight. 
You lookin too good to share  
And maybe our friends won't care
Baby, we always got next year. 
Baby let's just light the fire 
I'll get the matches  
Doesn't look real safe to drive  
I'll grab some glasses 
Won't know what we're missin'  
If we don't go out for Christmas tonight 
Maybe we should stay in, baby 
We won't know what we're missin'  
If we don't go out for Christmas tonight.

Ra pa pam pam 
Ra pa pam pam.

Space cowboy, Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga

Just wait and see this Christmas vacation. 
This old house sure is looking good 
Got ourselves the finest snowman in the neighborhood  
Ain't it fun, always on the run 
That's how its done on Christmas vacation. 
Lets all deck the halls and light the lights 
(jing-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling-ling) 
Get a toasty fire buring bright   
(jang-a-lang-a-lang-a-lang-lang) 
Give St. Nick the warmest welcome that he's every had  
We're so glad it Christmas vacation. 
And when the nights are peaceful and serene  
We can cuddle up and do our Christmas dreaming.
(jing-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling-ling)

Hip hip hooray! for Christmas vacation. 
Fa-la-la-la-la and ho ho ho 
Jingle, jangle, jingle as we go 
Let the spirit of the season..

Frosted window panes  
Candles gleaming inside  
Painted candy canes on the tree   
Santa's on his way  
He's filled his sleigh   
With things 
Things for you and for me.  

It's that time of year  
When the world falls in love   
Every song you hear   
Seems to say   
Merry Christmas   
May your New Year dreams come true   
And this song of mine   
In three quarter time   
Wishes you and yours   
The same thing too.
Merry Christmas   
May your New Year dreams come true   
And this song of mine   
In three quarter time   
Wishes you and yours   
The same thing too   
Merry Christmas to you.

We open up our hearts when love is in the air  
It seems such a shame to me  
It's a season that comes only once a year.
Chorus:   
So let's make a Christmas wish together  
Let's hope the best of dreams come true  
Let's make the spirit last forever  
This is my Christmas wish for you.
If I could give any gift I wanted  
A present to every boy and girl  
I'd make it a miracle that came from God above  
A picture of peace on earth  
Where each person is judged by the power of love.
Chorus:   
So let's make a Christmas wish together  
Let's hope the best of dreams come true  
Let's make the spirit last forever  
This is my Christmas wish for you.
It seems such a shame to me  
It's a season that comes only once a year.
Chorus:   
So let's make a Christmas wish together  
Let's hope the best of dreams come true  
Let's make the spirit last forever  
This is my Christmas wish for you.

Yes, all the world is happy, but since you went away  
My Christmas will be just another lonely day  
Yeah, another lonely day, yeah. 
My tree is trimmed with pretty colored lights  
And at the top, the Christmas star shines bright  
Yes, everything around me is very bright and gay  
But Christmas will be just another lonely day  
Yeah, another lonely day, yeah. 
I had a lonely September, October, November, too  
But December is twice as lonely without you 
For soon it will be time for Santa Claus  
And surely he will bring you back, because  
Without you here beside me, my world will be so gray  
And Christmas will be just another lonely day. 
Yeah, another lonely day, yeah  
Another lonely day, yeah  
Another lonely day, yeah. 

Like fireworks with no fuse   
Christmas without you.
The fireplace keeps burning  
And my thoughts keep turning   
The pages of memories  
Of time spent with you   
Old Christmas songs we knew  
And used to make love to   
Make it hard to get used to   
Christmas without you.
Christmas without you   
White Christmas and I'm blue 
I love you, I miss you, I need you   
So sad, but so true   
Christmas without you   
Like a mystery with no clues   
Like fireworks with no fuse   
Christmas without you.
The sweetest gift I know   
Would be if the new snow   
Could fall on your footsteps  
On this Christmas Eve   
The most joyous Christmas  
If luck could be with us   
Would be if Saint Nicholas  
Brought you home to me.
Christmas without you   
White Christmas and I'm blue 
I love you, I miss you, I need you   
So sad but so true   
Like a mystery with no clues   
Like fireworks with no fuse   
Christmas without you.

Tryin' hard to find a quiet moment  
Sharing love and joy  
Children with their toys  
Sadness fills my heart to see you go. 
Christmas won't be the same without you  
Christmas won't be the same if you go  
All I need to see  
Standing by my Christmas tree   
Christmas won't be the same without you. 
I remember when  
Times we used to spend  
Walking hard in hand until the sun sets  
Then came Christmas Eve  
The wish you gave to me  
How I wish I tried to make you stay. 
Christmas won't be the same without you  
Christmas won't be the same if you go  
All I need to see standing by my Christmas tree  
Christmas won't be the same without you. 
It's been a long long time  
I need you by my side  
Hold me tight  
Don't let go   
Let go. 
Christmas won't be the same without you  
Christmas won't be the same if you go   
All I need to see standing by my Christmas tree  
Christmas won't be the same without you. 
Christmas won't be the same without you  
Christmas won't be the same if you go  
All I need to see standing by my Christmas tree  
Christmas won't be the same 
Christmas won't be the same  
Christmas won't be the same  
Without you.

But all this year's been a busy blur  
Don't think I have the energy  
To add to my already mad rush  
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season.  
The perfect gift for me would be  
Completions and connections left from  
Last year, ski shop,  
Encounter, most interesting.  
Had his number but never the time  
Most of '81 passed along those lines. 
So deck those halls, trim those trees  
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer,  
I just need to catch my breath,  
Christmas by myself this year. 
Calendar picture, frozen landscape,  
Chilled this room for twenty-four days,  
Evergreens, sparkling snow  
Get this winter over with! 
Flashback to springtime, saw him again,  
Would've been good to go for lunch,  
Couldn't agree when we were both free,  
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch. 
Didn't, of course, 'til summertime,  
Out to the beach to his boat, could I join him?  
No, this time it was me,  
Sunburn in the third degree. 
Now the calendar's just one page  
And, of course, I am excited  
Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind  
Not to do too much about it. 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!   
But I think I'll miss this one this year.   
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!   
But I think I'll miss this one this year.  
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!   
But I think I'll miss this one this year.   
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!   
But I think I'll miss this one this year.   
Hardly dashing through the snow  
Cause I bundled up too tight  
Last minute have-to-do's  
A few cards a few calls  
'Cause it's r-s-v-p  
No thanks, no party lights  
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax  
Turned down all of my invites.
Last fall I had a night to myself,   
Same guy called, Halloween party,   
Waited all night for him to show,   
This time his car wouldn't go.
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late,   
Trudge on home to celebrate   
In a quiet way, unwind   
Doing Christmas right, this time. 
A&P has provided me   
With the world's smallest turkey   
Already in the oven, nice and hot   
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot? 
So on with the boots, back out in the snow   
To the only all-night grocery,   
When what to my wondering eyes should appear   
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year! 
"I'm spending this one alone," he said  
"Need a break; this year's been crazy."   
I said, "Me too, but why are you?   
You mean, you forgot cranberries too?" 
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed   
Caught on to what was happening   
That Christmas magic's brought this tale   
To a very happy ending! 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!   
Couldn't miss this one this year!   
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!   
Couldn't miss this one this year!

Cause everything I want is miles away 
In a snow covered little town.
My mamma's in the kitchen, worrying about me 
Season's greetings, hope you're well 
Well, I'm doing alright if you were wondering 
Lately I can never tell.
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time 
But, there were Christmases when you were mine.

I've been doing fine without you, really 
Up until the nights got cold 
And everybody's here, except you, baby 
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold.

But for me it's just a lonely time 
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine.
Merry Christmas everybody 
That'll have to be something I just say this year 
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater 
And were your cousins late again? 
When you were putting up the lights this year 
Did you notice one less pair of hands?
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time 
But there were Christmases  
When I didn't wonder how you are tonight 
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine.
You were mine.

I've been cleaning, scrubbing the plates  
And weeding out the garden, dear.
I can't fall asleep to your mystery  
Slowly blowing from the shore  
I have not failed to be, what you'd expect of me 
Swallowing glass, just to stay pure.
All the birds are heading down south 
But you're staying up north, you say 
I've got jackets, blankets and sheets  
Its going to be a cold December.
It could be warm you see 
A statue next to me 
Swimming away from the ice and snow 
Could I have failed to see, the signs in front of me 
Warning and flashing symbols 
Subtle and simple I couldn't see 
I couldnt see.
If only time could slow down 
Maybe I could come up 
It's such a cold December 
It's such a cold December 
Its so cold.
I can't fall asleep to your mystery  
Slowly blowing from the shore  
I have not failed to be, what you'd expect of me 
Swallowing glass, just to stay pure.
Summers come and summer has gone  
Your Christmas cards can't comfort me 
You've found new friends and tied all the ends 
It's freezing in the loneliest winter.
It could be warm you see 
A statue next to me 
Swimming away from the ice and snow 
Could I have failed to see, the signs in front of me 
Warning and flashing symbols 
Subtle and simple I couldn't see 
I couldnt see.
If only time could slow down 
Maybe I could come up 
It's such a cold December 
It's such a cold December 
Its so cold.

Cold December's winds were stilled  
In the month of snowing  
As the world fell dark one night  
Springtime's Hope was growing.  
Then one rose-tree blossomed new  
One sweet Flower on it grew  
On the tree once bare  
Grew the Rose so fair  
Ah, the Rose, ah, the Rose  
Ah the Rose tree blooming  
Sweet the air perfuming.
When the darkness fell that night  
Bringing sweet reposing  
All the land was hid from sight  
Sleep our eyes was closing.  
Suddenly, there came a gleam  
From the sky, the wondrous beam  
Of a heav'nly star  
Giving light afar  
Ah, the star, ah, the star  
Ah, the star-beam glowing  
Brightness ever growing. 
Now the month of May was here  
Filled with God's own radiance  
Now the purest Lily bloomed  
Flow'r of sweetest fragrance.  
To the people far and near  
Came a breath of heav'nly cheer  
O, the incense rare  
Of the Lily there!  
Ah, the scent, ah, the scent  
Of the Lily blooming,  
All the air perfuming!
In Catalonian: El Decembre Congelat  
El desembre congelat  
Confus es retira  
Abril de flors coronat  
Tot el mon admira  
Quan en un jadi d'amor  
Neix una divina flor.  
D'una ro ro ro  
D'una sa sa sa  
D'una ro, d'una sa  
D'una rosa bella  
Fecunda y poncella.
El primer Pare causa  
Le nit tenevrosa  
Que a tot el mon ofusca  
La vista penosa  
Mes en una mitja nit  
Brilla el sol que n'es eixit  
D'una bel bel bel  
D'una la la la  
D'una bel, d'una la  
D'una bella aurora  
Que el cel enamora.
El mes de maig ha florit  
Sense ser encara  
Un lliri blanc y polit  
De fragancia rara  
Que per tot el mon se sent  
De Llevant fins a Ponent  
Tota sa sa sa  
Tota dul dul dul  
Tota sa, tota dul  
Tota sa dulcura  
I olor, amb ventura.


The billboards and the neon took the place of silver bells 
And the temperature is 84 degrees.
I can hear the traffic on the crowded strip below 
As the palm trees poke their heads above the scene 
There's not a single reindeer and it hardly ever snows 
And Santa drives a Rolls Royce limousine.
But all along the Rockies you can feel it in the air 
From Telluride to Boulder down below 
The closest thing to heaven on this planet anywhere 
Is a quiet Christmas morning in the Colorado snow.
I remember Christmases when I was just a boy 
In the morning I would run to see the tree 
And the carolers on the hillside sang their songs of Christmas joy 
Well, I always thought they sang them just for me.
Now the sun is setting in the California sky 
And I can't find the spirit anywhere 
So I think its time for me to tell Los Angeles goodbye 
I'm going back home for Christmas there.
But all along the Rockies you can feel it in the air 
From Telluride to Boulder down below 
The closest thing to heaven on this planet anywhere 
Is a quiet Christmas morning in the Colorado snow.

Come, buy my nice fresh ivy  
And my holly sprigs so green  
I have the finest branches  
That ever yet were seen 
Come buy from me, good Christians   
And let me home, I pray  
That God will bless your Christmas  
And a happy New Year's Day.
Ah, won't you buy my ivy?  
It's the loveliest I've seen 
Ah, won't you buy my holly?  
Oh you who love the green  
Do take a little branch of each  
And on my knees I'll pray 
That God will bless your Christmas  
And a happy New Year's Day.

Come, O you shepherds, people, listen to me  
Go straight to Bethlehem, the baby to see 
For Christ is born a man now among you 
God come from heaven now here to save you 
Be not afraid! 
Let us go swiftly to Bethlehem's stall 
There to adore the gift revealed to us all 
What here we find we'll tell all mankind 
Give adoration, come, every nation 
Hallelujah! 
Truly the angel good news has revealed  
To Bethlehem's shepherds as before him they kneeled 
Now joy on earth to all men is here 
Peace among all, banishes fear 
Praise be to God!

Everybody likes to take a holiday  
Everybody likes to take a rest   
Spending time together with the family   
Sharing lots of love and happiness. 
Come on, ring those bells  
Light the Christmas tree  
Jesus is the king   
Born for you and me.   
Come on, ring those bells    
Everybody say  
Jesus, we remember   
This your birthday. 
Celebrations come because of something good   
Celebrations we love to recall   
Mary had a baby boy in Bethlehem   
The greatest celebration of all. 
Come on, ring those bells  
Light the Christmas tree  
Jesus is the King   
Born for you and me.   
Come on, ring those bells   
Everybody say  
Jesus, we remember   
This your birthday.

Born to set Thy people free; 
From our fears and sins release us, 
Let us find our rest in Thee. 
Israel's Strength and Consolation, 
Hope of all the earth Thou art; 
Dear Desire of every nation, 
Joy of every longing heart. 
Born Thy people to deliver, 
Born a child and yet a King, 
Born to reign in us forever, 
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring. 
By Thine own eternal Spirit 
Rule in all our hearts alone; 
By Thine all sufficient merit, 
Raise us to Thy glorious throne.

Let your songs of gladness ring  
In a stable lies the Holy  
In a manger rests the King  
See in Mary's arms reposing  
Christ by highest Heaven adored  
Come, your circle round Him closing  
Pious hearts that love the Lord.
Come ye poor, no pomp of station  
Robes the Child your hearts adore  
He, the Lord of all salvation  
Shares your want, is weak and poor  
Oxen, round about behold them  
Rafters naked, cold, and bare  
See the shepherds, God has told them  
That the Prince of Life lies there.
Come, ye children, blithe and merry  
This one Child your model make  
Christmas holly, leaf, and berry  
All be prized for His dear sake  
Come ye gentle hearts and tender  
Come ye spirits keen and bold  
All in all your homage render  
Weak and mighty, young and old.
High above a star is shining  
And the wise men haste from far  
Come, glad hearts, and spirits pining  
For you all has ris'n the star  
Let us bring our poor oblations  
Thanks and love, and faith and praise  
Come, ye people, come, ye nations  
All in all draw nigh to gaze.
Hark! the Heaven of heavens is ringing  
Christ the Lord to man is born!  
Are not all our hearts, too, singing  
Welcome, welcome, Christmas morn?  
Still the Child, all power possessing  
Smiles as through the ages past  
And the song of Christmas blessing  
Sweetly sinks to rest at last.

Just to think of all the cheer 
We could share if you were here.
I made my Christmas list 
That I'll give to my boy St.Nick  
And I hope he hooks, hooks me up 
Cause I plan a special Christmas for us.  
I was hoping that you might be coming for Christmas  
I was hoping that surely by New Years eve 
I was hoping that you might be coming  
And I hope that your bringing something for me. 
Now we'll chill Christmas eve 
I can't wait for my moms to leave   
We'll snuggle, I'll turn down the lights   
And give our gifts, if the timing is right. 
I was hoping that you might be coming for Christmas  
I was hoping that surely by New Years eve 
I was hoping that you might be coming  
And I hope that your bringing something for me. 
For know I will and I hope that Santa won't be late  
Cause I don't want no presents 
See I am too old for toys, I just want my baby  
She's my one and only, truly one and only, she's my only.
I was hoping that you might be coming for Christmas  
I was hoping that surely by New Years eve 
I was hoping that you might be coming  
And I hope that your bringing something for me.

Lully, lullay, Thou little tiny Child  
By, by, lully, lullay  
Lullay, Thou little tiny Child  
By, by, lully, lullay.
O sisters too, how may we do  
For to preserve this day  
This poor youngling for whom we sing  
By, by, lully, lullay.
Herod the king, in his raging  
Charged he hath this day  
His men of might, in his own sight  
All children young to slay.
That woe is me, poor Child for Thee! 
And ever morn and day 
For thy parting neither say nor sing  
By, by, lully, lullay.

There'll be a new world beginnin' from tonight! 
Where I climb up to my saddle 
Gonna take Him to my heart! 
There'll be a new world beginnin' from tonight!
Right across the prairie, 
Clear across the valley, 
Straight across the heart of every man, 
There'll be a right new brand of livin' 
That'll sweep like lightnin' fire 
And take away the hate from every land.
Chorus:
There'll be a new world beginnin' from tonight! 
There'll be a new world beginnin' from tonight! 
Where I climb up to my saddle 
Gonna take Him to my heart! 
There'll be a new world beginnin' from tonight!
Yoi, yippee! We're gonna ride the trail! 
Yoi, yippee! We're gonna ride today! 
When I climb up to my saddle, 
Gonna take him to my heart! 
There'll be a new world beginnin' from tonight!
Chorus:
There'll be a new world beginnin' from tonight! 
There'll be a new world beginnin' from tonight! 
Where I climb up to my saddle 
Gonna take Him to my heart! 
There'll be a new world beginnin' from tonight!

Laid the Son of Man His head  
Sleeping His first earthly slumber 
Where the oxen had been fed.  
Happy were those shepherds listening  
To the holy angel's word  
Happy they within that stable  
Worshiping their infant Lord.
Happy all who hear the message  
Of His coming from above  
Happier still who hail His coming  
And with praises greet His love.  
Blessed Savior, Christ most holy  
In a manger Thou didst rest  
Canst Thou stoop again, yet lower  
And abide within my breast?
Evil things are there before Thee  
In the heart, where they have fed  
Wilt Thou pitifully enter  
Son of Man, and lay Thy head?  
Enter, then, O Christ most holy  
Make a Christmas in my heart  
Make a heaven of my manger  
It is heaven where Thou art.
And to those who never listened  
To the message of Thy birth  
Who have winter, but no Christmas  
Bringing them Thy peace on earth  
Send to these the joyful tidings  
By all people, in each home  
Be there heard the Christmas anthem  
Praise to God, the Christ has come!

It tells of the coming of wonders untold   
Forgotten is winter, its fury and cold   
Hi-ho, hi-ho, well soon see the candles glow   
Hi-ho, hi-ho, well soon see the candles glow.
When darkness is falling and shadows grow long   
Its time for the children to sing this old song   
It tells of the coming of wonders untold   
Forgotten is winter, its fury and cold   
Hi-ho, hi-ho, well soon see the candles glow   
Hi-ho, hi-ho, well soon see the candles glow.
When darkness is falling and stars fill the sleigh   
The waiting is over and we all know why   
Its time for celebrating and having a feast   
Because of the tidings that come from the east   
Hi-ho, hi-ho, well soon see the candles glow   
Hi-ho, hi-ho, well soon see the candles glow.

Low in a manger 
Dear little Stranger 
Jesus, the wonderful Savior was born 
There was none to receive Him 
None to believe Him 
None but the angels were watching that morn.
Dear little Stranger 
Slept in a manger 
No downy pillow under His head 
But with the poor 
He slumbered secure 
The dear little Babe in His bed.
Angels descending 
Over Him bending 
Chanted a tender and silent refrain 
Then a wonderful story 
Told of His glory 
Unto the shepherds on Bethlehem's plain.
Dear little Stranger 
Slept in a manger 
No downy pillow under His head 
But with the poor 
He slumbered secure 
The dear little Babe in His bed.
Dear little Stranger 
Born in a manger 
Maker and Monarch 
And Savior of all 
I will love Thee forever 
Grieve Thee? No, never! 
Thou didst for me make Thy bed in a stall.
Dear little Stranger 
Slept in a manger 
No downy pillow under His head 
But with the poor 
He slumbered secure 
The dear little Babe in His bed.

And I hope you won't forgot

To get my senorita

Come true.
Sweet December song 
The melody that saved me 
On those less than silent nights 
When snow would fall upon my bed 
Like sugar from Jesus 
And take me to the day 
She could always smile 
The Virgin n' Child would always show 
You see 
Just to save me 
(Just to save me).
There was always Christmas time 
To wipe the year away 
I guess that Mum and Dad decided 
That the war would have to wait.
There was always Christmas time 
Jesus came to stay 
I could believe in peace on Earth 
And I could watch TV all day 
So I dreamed of Christmas.
Maybe since you've gone 
I went a little crazy 
God knows they can see  
(The Child) 
But the snow that falls upon my bed 
That loving I needed 
Falls every single day 
For each and every child 
The Virgin smiles for all to see 
But you kept her from me.
There was always Christmas time 
To wipe the year away 
I guess that Mum and Dad decided 
That the war would have to wait.
There was always Christmas time 
Jesus came to stay 
I could believe in peace on Earth 
And I could watch TV all day 
And so I dreamed of Christmas 
Yes, I dreamed like you.
Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas 
May your every New Year dream  
Come true.

While Bing Crosby sings white Christmas 
He makes you feel nice.
December will be magic again 
Old Saint Nicholas up the chimney 
Just a-popping up in my memory.
Ooh, dropping down in my parachute 
The white city, she is so beautiful 
Upon the black-soot icicled roofs.
Ooh, and see how I fall 
See how I fall 
(Fall!) 
Like the snow.
Come to cover the lovers 
(Cover the lovers, but don't you wake them up) 
Come to sparkle the dark up 
(Sparkle the dark up, with just a touch of make-up) 
Come to cover the muck up 
(Cover the muck up, ooh, with a little luck).
December will be magic again 
Light the candle lights 
To conjure Mr. Wilde.
Into the Silent Night 
Ooh, it's quiet inside 
Here in Oscar's mind.
December will be magic again 
Don't miss the brightest star 
Kiss under mistletoe 
I want to hear you laugh 
Don't let the mystery go now.
Ooh, dropping down in my parachute 
The white city, she is so beautiful 
Upon the black-soot icicled roofs.
Ooh, and see how I fall 
See how I fall 
(Fall!) 
Like the snow.
Come to cover the lovers 
(Cover the lovers, but don't you wake them up) 
Come to sparkle the dark up 
(Sparkle the dark up, with just a touch of make-up) 
Come to cover the muck up 
(Cover the muck up, ooh, with a little luck).
Oh, I'm coming to cover the lovers 
Ooh, and I'm coming to sparkle the dark up.

With his red suit on  
Dig that walk, that crazy talk 
Man, oh man, he's really gone. 
Dig that crazy Santa Claus  
With his bag of toys  
Drags his sack  
Through a chimney stack  
All the little hep-cats jump for joy. 
So cool it, Rudolph, cool it 
With your nose aglow  
Tell those groovy reindeer 
When Santa starts to blow 
Go, go. 
Dig that crazy Santa Claus 
Well, I do believe  
He will bring some crazy toys 
You better be good this Christmas Eve  
Jump.

Well, dig that crazy Santa Claus  
With his red suit on  
Dig that walk, that crazy talk 
Man, oh man, he's really gone. 
Dig that crazy Santa Claus  
With his bag of toys  
Drags his sack

Well, I do believe  
He will bring some crazy toys 
You better be good this Christmas Eve.



The story of a Christmas bell  
That used to shine  
And chime and ring 
And why they called him  
Ding a Ling. 
One of the famous jingle bells  
Is what he was  
But then he fell 
And broke his pretty harmony 
And he began to ring off key. 
Now they call him  
Ding a Ling  
Because he has  
A funny ring   
And doesn't hear  
His note too well 
Ding a Ling   
The Christmas bell. 
The other bells met secretly  
And he heard one say  
In a real low key  
He's sure to ruin   
Our Christmas sound   
And we don't want him  
Hangin' around. 
He over heard  
The secret vote  
And walked away  
With a lump in his note 
The saddest bell  
You've ever seen 
The Christmas bell  
Called Ding a Ling. 
They all call him  
Ding a Ling  
Because he has  
A funny ring   
And doesn't hear  
His note too well 
Ding a Ling   
The Christmas bell. 
The snow was falling 
In the square 
When the children  
Found him there  
And placed him  
On the Christmas tree 
For everyone in town to see. 
As Christmas Eve  
Came to the town  
A blinding snow  
Was coming down  
And Ding a Ling  
Heard someone say   
Ol' Santa's sure  
To lose his way.
The thought occured   
To Ding a Ling  
To ring as loud  
As he could ring 
And when ol' Santa  
Heard the sound 
It guided him to town. 
Now the children shout and sing  
And everyone loves  
Ding a Ling 
So everything has turned out well   
For Ding a Ling  
The Christmas bell.

Ring out the old 
Ring in the new. 
Ring out the false 
Ring in the true 
Ring out the old 
Ring in the new. 
Ding-dong, ding-dong 
Ding-dong, ding-dong 
Ding-dong, ding-dong 
Ding-dong, ding-dong.
Yesterday  
Today was tomorrow 
And tomorrow 
Today will be yesterday. 
So, ring out the old 
Ring in the new 
Ring out the old 
Ring in the new. 
Ring out the false 
Ring in the true 
Ring out the old 
Ring in the new. 
Ding-dong, ding-dong

Ding dong merrily on high  
In heav'n the bells are ringing 
Ding dong! verily the sky 
Is riv'n with angel singing. 
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!
E'en so here below, below 
Let steeple bells be swungen 
And "Io, io, io!" 
By priest and people sungen 
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!
Pray you, dutifully prime 
Your matin chime, ye ringers 
May you beautifully rime 
Your evetime song, ye singers 
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!

There's no need to be afraid  
At Christmastime, we let in light  And we banish shade  
And in our world of plenty  
We can spread a smile of joy  
Throw your arms around  
The world at Christmastime.
But say a prayer..
Pray for the other ones  
At Christmastime it's hard   
But when you're having fun  
There's a world outside your window  
And it's a world of dread and fear  
Where the only water flowing  
Is the bitter sting of tears  
And the Christmas bells that   
Ring there are the clanging  
Chimes of doom  
Well, tonight thank God   
It's them instead of you.
And there won't be snow   
In Africa this Christmastime  
The greatest gift they'll get   
This year is life  
(Oooh) Where nothing ever grows  
No rain nor rivers flow  
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?
(Here's to you) raise a glass for everyone  
(Here's to them) underneath that burning sun  
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?
Feed the world  
Feed the world  
Feed the world.
Let them know 
It's Christmastime again.
Feed the world  
Let them know 
It's Christmastime again.

Said the night wind to the little lamb  
"Do you see what I see?   
Way up in the sky, little lamb  
Do you see what I see?   
A star, a star, dancing in the night   
With a tail as big as a kite  
With a tail as big as a kite." 
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy  
"Do you hear what I hear?   
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear?   
A song, a song high above the trees   
With a voice as big as the the sea   
With a voice as big as the the sea." 
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king  
"Do you know what I know?   
In your palace warm, mighty king   
Do you know what I know?   
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
Let us bring him silver and gold." 
Said the king to the people everywhere  
"Listen to what I say!   
Pray for peace, people, everywhere  
Listen to what I say!   
The Child, the Child sleeping in the night  
He will bring us goodness and light   
He will bring us goodness and light."

It's Dominick the donkey  
Chingedy ching  
(hee-haw, hee-haw)  
The Italian Christmas donkey.  
(la la la-la la-la la la la la)  
(la la la-la la-la la-ee-oh-da)
Santa's got a little friend  
His name is Dominick  
The cutest little donkey  
You never see him kick  
When Santa visits his paisans  
With Dominick he'll be  
Because the reindeer cannot  
Climb the hills of Italy.
Hey! Chingedy ching

(la la la-la la-la la la la la)  
(la la la-la la-la la-ee-oh-da)
Jingle bells around his feet  
And presents on the sled  
Hey! Look at the mayor's derby  
On top of Dominick's head  
A pair of shoes for Louie  
And a dress for Josephine  
The labels on the inside says  
They're made in Bruccalin'.
Hey! Chingedy ching

Children sing, and clap their hands  
And Dominick starts to dance  
They talk Italian to him  
And he even understands  
Cummare's and Cumpare's  
Do the dance 'a tarantell'  
When Santa Nicola comes to town  
And brings 'o ciucciarell'.

But you may still slide 
Baby, it's not your sleigh ride 
But this year is ours 
Maybe tomorrow 
We're gonna see things  
We never believed 
I'll make you want me  
You'll see 
The initial warning is free 
But only to reindeer 
Oh what a sight 
As they take their first flight 
Oh darling, it's all in time 
But I will.
We're going to turn  
All men in to the sky 
Oh what a sight, beautiful 
And I will 
I will sleep tonight 
I will sleep tonight.

Santa: That's funny, kid  
Because, I've been coming for you. 
Flowers: Oh, Santa  
I've been killing just for fun. 
Santa: Well, the party's over kid  
Because I  
Because I got a bullet in my gun. 
Flowers : A bullet in your what? 
Band: Santa's got a bullet in his gun 
You know it 
Santa's got a bullet in his gun.
Flowers: Don't shoot me Santa Claus  
I've been a clean living boy  
I promise you  
Did every little thing you asked me to  
I can't believe the things I'm going through. 
Flowers: Don't shoot me Santa Claus  
Well, no one else around believes me  
But the children on the block, they tease me  
I couldn't let them off that easy  
Oh Santa. 
Flowers: It's been a real hard year.
Santa: There just ain't no gettin' around this  
Life is hard  
But look at me  
I turned out alright. 
Flowers: Hey Santa! 
Why don't we talk about it? 
Work it out?
Santa: Believe me  
This ain't what I wanted  
I love all you kids 
You know that.
Santa: Hell, I remember when you were just 10 years old  
Playing out there in the desert  
Just waiting for a sip of that sweet Mojave rain.
Band: In the sweet Mojave rain  
The boy was on his own. 
Flowers: Don't shoot me Santa Claus  
I've been a clean living boy  
I promise you  
Did every little thing you asked me to  
I can't believe the things I'm going through. 
Flowers: Hey Santa! 
Well, no one else around believes me  
But the children on the block, they tease me  
I couldn't let them off that easy. 
Flowers: They had it coming  
So, why can't you see?  
I couldn't turn my cheek no longer  
The sun is going down and Christmas is near  
Just look the other way 
I'll disappear forever. 
Woo!
Flowers: Don't shoot me Santa Claus  
Well, no one else around believes me  
But the children on the street, they tease me  
I couldn't let them off that easy. 
Believe  
Me  
Santa  
Santa.

Down in yon forest there stands a hall  
The bells of Paradise I heard them ring  
It's covered all over with purple and pall  
And I love my Lord Jesus above anything.
In that hall there stands a bed  
The bells of Paradise I heard them ring  
It's covered all over with scarlet so red  
And I love my Lord Jesus above anything.
At the bed side there lies a stone  
The bells of Paradise I heard them ring  
Which the sweet Virgin Mary knelt upon  
And I love my Lord Jesus above anything.
Under that bed there runs a flood  
The bells of Paradise I heard them ring  
The one half runs water, the other runs blood  
And I love my Lord Jesus above anything.
At the bed's foot there grows a thorn  
The bells of Paradise I heard them ring  
Which ever blows blossom since he was born  
And I love my Lord Jesus above anything.
Over that bed the moon shines bright  
The bells of Paradise I heard them ring  
Denoting our Saviour was born this night  
And I love my Lord Jesus above anything.

Oh, I cant wait to see those faces  
Im driving home for Christmas, yeah!  
Well, I'm moving down that line  
And its been so long  
But I will be there  
I sing this song  
To pass the time away  
Driving in my car  
Driving home for Christmas.
Its gonna take some time  
But I'll get there  
Top to toe in tailbacks  
Oh, I got red lights on the run  
But soon there'll be a freeway  
Get my feet on holy ground.
So I sing for you  
Though you can't hear me  
When I get through  
And feel you near me  
I am driving home for Christmas  
Driving home for Christmas  
With a thousand memories.
I take look at the driver next to me  
He's just the same  
Just the same.
Top to toe in tailbacks  
Oh, I got red lights on the run  
I am driving home for Christmas, yeah!  
Get my feet on holy ground  
So I sing for you  
Though you can't hear me  
When I get through  
And feel you near me  
Driving in my car  
Driving home for Christmas  
Driving home for Christmas  
With a thousand memories.

We bring the evergreen  
Young ones wait  
While the old ones make up  
Tales of how it used to be.
China dolls  
Candy corn  
Painted wooden toys  
Treasures found  
To the wondrous sound  
Of caroling  
The savior  
Born to us on Christmas morn.
Emmanuel  
God with us  
Emmanuel!  
Emmanuel  
God with us  
The Son of Israel.
And still he calls  
Through the night  
Beyond the days of old  
A voice of peace  
To the weary ones  
Who struggle with the human soul.
All of us  
Travelers  
Through a given time  
Who can know  
What tomorrow holds?   
But over the horizon  
Surely you and I will find.
Emmanuel  
God with us  
Emmanuel!  
Emmanuel  
God with us  
The Son of Israel.
And the years they come  
And the years they go  
Though we may forget somehow  
That the Child once born in Bethlehem  
Is still among us now.
Emmanuel  
God with us  
Emmanuel!  
Emmanuel  
God with us  
The Son of Israel.
Emmanuel  
God with us  
Emmanuel!  
Emmanuel  
God with us  
The Son of Israel.

But I'm so sentimental 
And I'm so hopeful you'll be there  
So, here I am every year, every Christmas.
I've wished for you in my heart, and in my head  
And I got my answer that first moment that we met  
And, oh yes, I believed you as you told me, as you said  
You'd be here every year, every Christmas.
There must be a lesson for me to learn  
If you don't trust in love, you'll get nothing in return  
Why should I be lonely, don't tell me it's right  
I have my pride, but I'd rather be with you tonight.

So much emotion, it's driving me mad  
But I'll take my chances with these feelings that I have  
And I'll come back to this same corner where we met  
And I'll be here every year, every Christmas.

Mere words can't explain the pain and the fear  
'Cause oh, I wonder, yes, I wonder, are you gonna leave me standing here?  
Today's almost over, but I don't want to leave  
Has my heart made a fool out of me?
My friends gather round me with holiday cheer  
They say to forget you, to let you go 'cause you're not here  
Well, I can't keep explaining what they'll never understand  
And why I'm here every year, every Christmas  
I return every year, every Christmas  
I come here every year, every Christmas. 

December rolled around  
And you were counting on it to roll out. 
Well, everything's gonna be cool this Christmas  
Everything's gonna be cool this Christmas  
Everything's gonna be cool this Christmas. 
Well everybody's lookin' for you down at the house   
The tree is looking so inspired 
There's a yuletide groove waitin' for you to move  
I'll go and throw another log on the fire. 
Everything's gonna be cool this Christmas  
Everything's gonna be cool this Christmas  
Everything's gonna be cool this Christmas. 
As days go by the more we need friends  
And the harder they are to find  
If I could have a friend like you all my life 
Well I guess I'd be doin' just fine. 
Everything's gonna be cool this Christmas 
Everything's gonna be cool this Christmas  
Everything's gonna be cool this Christmas.

In the drunk tank  
An old man said to me  
"Won't see another one"  
And then he sang a song  
The Rare Old Mountain Dew  
I turned my face away  
And dreamed about you.
Got on a lucky one  
Came in eighteen to one  
I've got a feeling  
This year's for me and you.  
So happy Christmas  
I love you, baby  
I can see a better time  
When all our dreams come true.
They've got cars big as bars  
They've got rivers of gold  
But the wind goes right through you  
It's no place for the old.  
When you first took my hand  
On a cold Christmas Eve  
You promised me  
Broadway was waiting for me.
You were handsome  
You were pretty  
Queen of New York City  
When the band finished playing  
They howled out for more  
Sinatra was swinging  
All the drunks they were singing  
We kissed on a corner  
Then danced through the night.
The boys of the NYPD choir  
Were singing "Galway Bay"  
And the bells were ringing out  
For Christmas day.
You're a bum  
You're a punk  
You're an old slut on junk  
Lying there almost dead  
On a drip in that bed.  
You scumbag, you maggot  
You cheap lousy faggot  
Happy Christmas, your arse  
I pray God it's our last.
I could have been someone  
Well, so could anyone  
You took my dreams from me  
When I first found you.  
I kept them with me, babe  
I put them with my own  
Can't make it all alone  
I've built my dreams around you.

Shepherds of old heard the joyous strains.
Refrain: 
Glory to God, glory to God,  
Glory to God in the highest;  
Peace on earth, good will to men;  
Peace on earth, good will to men.
Sweet are these strains of redeeming love,  
Message of mercy from heaven above.
Refrain: 
Glory to God, glory to God,  
Glory to God in the highest;  
Peace on earth, good will to men;  
Peace on earth, good will to men.
Lord, with the angels we too would rejoice;  
Help us to sing with the heart and voice.
Refrain: 
Glory to God, glory to God,  
Glory to God in the highest;  
Peace on earth, good will to men;  
Peace on earth, good will to men.
Hasten the time when, from every clime,  
Men shall unite in the strains sublime.
Refrain: 
Glory to God, glory to God,  
Glory to God in the highest;  
Peace on earth, good will to men;  
Peace on earth, good will to men.

Christmas break, a time for touching home 
The heart of all he'd known 
And leaving was so hard.
Three thousand miles away 
Now he's working Christmas Day 
Making double time for the minding of the store 
Well, he always said, he'd make it on his own 
He's spending Christmas Eve alone 
First Christmas away from home.
She's standing by the train station 
Pan-handling for change 
Four more dollars buys a decent meal and a room 
Looks like the Sally Ann place after all 
In a crowded sleeping hall 
That echoes like a tomb.
But it's warm and clean and free 
And there are worse places to be 
At least it means no beating from her Dad 
And if she cries because it's Christmas Day 
She hopes that it won't show 
First Christmas away from home.
In the apartment stands a tree 
And it looks so small and bare 
Not like it was meant to be 
Golden angel on the top 
It's not that same old silver star 
You wanted for your own 
First Christmas away from home.
In the morning, they get prayers 
Then it's crafts and tea downstairs 
Then another meal back in his little room 
Hoping maybe that the boys 
Will think to phone before the day is gone 
Well, it's best they do it soon.
When the old girl passed away 
He fell apart more every day 
Each had always kept the other pretty well 
But the kids all said, the nursing home was best 
Cause he couldn't live alone 
First Christmas away from home.
In the common room, they've got the biggest tree 
And it's huge and cold and lifeless 
Not like it ought to be 
And the lit-up flashing Santa Claus on top 
It's not that same old silver star 
You once made for your own 
First Christmas away from home.



Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay  
In fields where they lay tending their sheep  
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel.
They looked up and saw a star  
Shining in the east, beyond them far  
And to the earth it gave great light  
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel.
And by the light of that same star  
Three Wise Men came from country far  
To seek for a King was their intent  
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel.
This star drew nigh to the northwest  
Over Bethlehem it took its rest  
And there it did both stop and stay  
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel.
Then did they know assuredly  
Within that house the King did lie  
One entered it them for to see  
And found the Babe in poverty.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel.
Then entered in those Wise Men three  
Full reverently upon the knee  
And offered there, in His presence  
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel.
Between an ox stall and an ass  
This Child truly there He was  
For want of clothing they did Him lay  
All in a manger, among the hay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel.
Then let us all with one accord  
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord  
That hath made Heaven and earth of naught  
And with His blood mankind hath bought.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel.
If we in our time shall do well  
We shall be free from death and hell  
For God hath prepared for us all  
A resting place in general.  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel.

When it drifted to and frost  
Why you should've seen the snow  
It was near seven feet or more  
By the old barn door.
Oh the first snowfall of the winter  
What a joy for a boy to behold  
In each house you'll find a sleigh  
That was waiting for this day  
And of course, down the road a hill  
For each Jack and Jill.
Every winter breeze that scurries  
Sets the snowflakes up in flurries  
It's the good old sentimental season when  
Folks put runners on their surreys  
And forget about their worries  
When a man becomes a boy once again.
Oh, the first snowfall of the winter  
Jingle bells bring us spells ever dear  
Under wintry skies of gray  
It was snowing all the day  
And it showed no signs of stopping  
Every kid with eyes of popping  
Will soon be belly-whopping on his ear.
On the first snowfall of the winter  
Oh, the first snowfall of the year  
The first snow of the year  
Is just about the best snow  
Well, I'll say any snow  
Is a pretty good show.

We got the lights up on the tree now   
And we're ready for the holiday.
The radio's playing all the Christmas songs  
Just the way that we like  
There's only five more days  
And I can't wait  
It's almost Christmas time.
There's 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 more days  
All around the world  
You know there's 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 more days  
For every boy and girl.
Five more nights for Santa 
To get ready for Christmas Eve  
And you tell me that you got me something  
But I'm gonna have to wait and see.
Everybody get a little closer now   
You know we're gonna do it right  
There's only five more days and I can't wait  
It's almost Christmas time.
There's 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 more days  
All around the world  
You know there's 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 more days  
For every boy and girl.
Everybody ready for their favorite holiday  
All around, counting down   
You know there's only five more days.
The radio's playing all the Christmas songs  
Just the way that we like  
There's only one more week and I can't wait  
It's almost Christmas time.
There's 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 more days  
All around the world  
You know there's 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 more days  
For every boy and girl.
There's five more days, five more days  
Been waiting so long for this  
Then four more days, four more days  
Gonna get my Christmas wish 
Now it's three more days, three more days  
'Til the best time of the year  
Everybody say, two more days, one more day  
And now Christmas is finally here.
I've been waiting for a long, long time  
And Christmas is finally here.

Unto us a Son is given 
And the government 
Shall be upon His shoulder 
And his name shall be called  Wonderful 
Counselor 
The Mighty God 
The Everlasting Father 
The Prince of Peace.

From heaven above to earth I come  
To bear good news to every home  
Glad tidings of great joy I bring  
Whereof I now will say and sing.
"To you this night is born a child  
Of Mary, chosen virgin mild  
This little child, of lowly birth   
Shall be the joy of all the earth."
"This is the Christ, our God and Lord  
Who in all need shall aid afford  
He will Himself your Savior be  
From all your sins to set you free."
"He will on you the gifts bestow  
Prepared by God for all below  
That in His kingdom, bright and fair  
You may with us His glory share."
"These are the tokens ye shall mark  
The swaddling-clothes and manger dark  
There ye shall find the Infant laid  
By whom the heavens and earth were made."
Now let us all with gladsome cheer  
Go with the shepherds and draw near  
To see the precious gift of God,  
Who hath His own dear Son bestowed.
Give heed, my heart, lift up thine eyes!  
What is it in yon manger lies?  
Who is this child, so young and fair?  
The blessed Christ-child lieth there.
Welcome to earth, Thou noble Guest,  
Through whom the sinful world is blest!  
Thou com'st to share my misery  
What thanks shall I return to Thee?
Ah, Lord, who hast created all  
How weak art Thou, how poor and small  
That Thou dost choose Thine infant bed  
Where humble cattle lately fed!
Were earth a thousand times as fair  
Beset with gold and jewels rare  
It yet were far too poor to be  
A narrow cradle, Lord, for Thee.
For velvets soft and silken stuff  
Thou hast but hay and straw so rough  
Whereon Thou, King, so rich and great  
As 'twere Thy heaven, art throned in state.
And thus, dear Lord, it pleaseth Thee  
To make this truth quite plain to me  
That all the world's wealth, honor, might  
Are naught and worthless in Thy sight.
Ah, dearest Jesus, holy Child  
Make Thee a bed, soft, undefiled  
Within my heart, that it may be  
A quiet chamber kept for Thee.
My heart for very joy doth leap  
My lips no more can silence keep  
I, too, must sing with joyful tongue  
That sweetest ancient cradle-song.
Glory to God in highest heaven  
Who unto us His Son hath given!  
While angels sing with pious mirth  
A glad new year to all the earth.

Frosty the snowman  
Was a jolly happy soul  
With a corncob pipe  
And a button nose 
And two eyes made out of coal.
Frosty the snowman  
Is a fairy tale, they say 
He was made of snow 
But the children know  
How he came to life one day.
There must have been some magic  
In that old silk hat they found 
For when they placed it on his head 
He began to dance around.
Frosty the snowman 
Was alive as he could be 
And the children say he could laugh 
And play just the same as you and me.
Thumpetty thump thump 
Thumpety thump thump 
Look at Frosty go 
Thumpetty thump thump 
Thumpety thump thump 
Over the hills of snow.
Frosty the snowman 
Knew the sun was hot that day 
So he said, "Let's run  
And we'll have some fun 
Now, before I melt away".
Down to the village 
With a broomstick in his hand 
Running here and there  
All around the square 
Saying, "catch me if you can".
He led them down the streets of town 
Right to the traffic cop 
And he only paused a moment when 
He heard him holler "Stop!"
Frosty the snow man 
Had to hurry on his way 
But he waved goodbye 
Saying, "Don't you cry, 
I'll be back again some day".
Thumpetty thump thump 
Thumpety thump thump 
Look at Frosty go  
Thumpetty thump thump 
Thumpety thump thump 
Over the hills of snow.

O, do not answer with a sigh  
From the skies your radiance beaming  
Pierce the darkness with your gleaming  
Fum, fum, fum!

The angel Gabriel from heaven came  
With wings as drifted snow, with eyes as flame  
"All hail to thee, O lowly maiden Mary  
Most highly favored lady. Gloria!" 
"For know a blessed mother thou shalt be  
All generations laud and honor thee  
Thy son shall be Emmanuel, by seers foretold  
Most highly favored lady." Gloria! 
Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head  
"To me be as it pleaseth God," she said  
"My soul shall laud and magnify God's holy name."  
"Most highly favored lady." Gloria!  
Of her, Emmanuel, the Christ, was born  
In Bethlehem all on a Christmas morn  
And Christian folk through-out the world will ever say  
"Most highly favored lady." Gloria!


Rejoice, rejoice!  
Christ is born  
Of the Virgin Mary 
Rejoice!
It is now the time of grace 
That we have desired 
Let us sing songs of joy 
Let us give devotion 
God was made man 
And nature marvels 
The world was renewed 
By Christ who is King.
The closed gate of Ezekiel 
Has been passed through 
From where the light rises 
Salvation is found 
Therefore let our assembly now sing 
Sing the Psalms to purify us 
Let it praise the Lord.
Latin 

Gaudete, gaudete!  
Christus est natus  
Ex Maria virgine  
Gaudete!
Tempus adest gratiae  
Hoc quod optibamus  
Carmina laetitiae  
Devote redamus  
Deus homo factus est  
Natura mirante  
Mundus renovatus est  
A Christo regnante.
Ezechielis porta  
Clausa pertransitur  
Unde lux est orta  
Salus invenitur  
Ergo nostra cantio  
Psallat iam in lustro  
Benedicat Domino  
Salus Regi nostro.





Gentle Mary laid her Child  
Lowly in a manger  
There He lay, the undefiled   
To the world a Stranger. 
Such a Babe in such a place  
Can he be the Saviour?   
Ask the saved of all the race   
Who have found His favor. 
Angels sang about His birth,   
Wise men sought and found Him;   
Heaven's star shone brightly forth   
Glory all around Him.   
Shepherds saw the wondrous sight,   
Heard the angels singing;   
All the plains were lit that night,   
All the hills were ringing. 
Gentle Mary laid her Child   
Lowly in a manger;   
He is still the undefiled,   
But no more a Stranger.   
Son of God of humble birth,   
Beautiful the story;   
Praise His Name in all the earth,   
Hail! the King of Glory!

When blossoms flower e'er 'mid the snow  
Upon a winter night  
Was born the Child, the Christmas Rose  
The King of Love and Light.
The angels sang, the shepherds sang  
The grateful earth rejoiced  
And at His blessed birth the stars  
Their exultation voiced.
O come let us adore Him  
O come let us adore Him  
O come let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord.
Again the heart with rapture glows  
To greet the holy night 
That gave the world its Christmas Rose 
Its King of Love and Light.
Let ev'ry voice acclaim His name 
The grateful chorus swell 
From paradise to earth He came 
That we with Him might dwell. 
O come let us adore Him  
O come let us adore Him  
O come let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord.

Give heed, my heart, lift up thine eyes  
What is it in that manger lies? 
Who is the Child so young and fair? 
The blessed Christ Child lieth there.
My heart for very joy doth leap 
My lips no more can silence keep 
I, too, must sing, with joyful tongue 
That sweetest, dearest cradle song.
Glory to God in highest heaven 
Who unto man His Son has given 
While angels sing, our hearts to cheer 
To all the earth a glad new year!

It's a time to be kind 
To one and all 
It's that time of year 
When good friends are dear 
And you wish  
You could give more 
Than just presents  
From a store.
Why don't you 
Give love on Christmas day? 
(On Christmas day) 
Oh, even the man  
Who has everything 
Would be so happy  
If you would bring him  
Love on Christmas day  
(On Christmas day) 
No greater gift is there  
Than love.
People you don't know  
Smiling out hello 
Everywhere  
There's an air of Christmas joy 
It's that once a year 
When the world's sincere 
And you'd like to find a way 
To show the things  
That words can't say.
Why don't you 
Give love on Christmas day? 
(On Christmas day) 
The man on the street  
And the couple upstairs 
All need to know  
There's someone one cares 
Give love on Christmas day  
(Christmas day) 
No greater gift is there  
Than love 
What the world needs 
Is love 
Yes, the world needs  
Your love.
Why don't you  
Give love on Christmas day?  
(On Christmas Day) 
Oh, every little child  
On Santa's knee 
Has room for your love  
Underneath his tree. 
Give love on Christmas day 
(Christmas day) 
No greater gift is there  
Than love 
What the world needs  
Is love 
Yes, the world needs  
Your love.

Let every beat, sing to repeat 
Our love will last each moment of the year.
Just give me your heart for Christmas 
Only your love will do 
And with each sigh, you'll know that I 
Have given you my heart for Christmas, too. 

And when it's Christmas eve 
We'll sit around the tree 
And hear the church bells ring 
They're ringing for you and me. 

So, give me your heart 
Give me your heart darling, for Christmas 
Open it wide for me, just for Christmas 
And in return my love will burn 
As bright as every candle on the tree 
Give me your heart for Christmas.

Your music tells 
The sweet and pleasant story; 
How came to earth  
In lowly birth 
The Lord of life and glory.
No palace hall  
Its ceiling tall 
His kingly head spread over; 
There only stood  
A stable rude 
The heavenly Babe to cover.
No raiment gay  
As there He lay 
Adorned the infant Stranger; 
Poor, humble Child  
Of mother mild 
She laid Him in a manger.
But from afar  
A splendid star 
The wise men westward turning; 
The livelong night  
Saw pure and bright 
Above His birth place burning.

Gloria in excelsis deo 
Et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis 
Laudamus te 
Benedicimus te 
Adoramus te 
Glorificamus te 
Gratias agimus tibi propter magnam gloriam tuam 
Domine Deus, Rex caelestis, Deus Pater omnipotens 
Domine fili unigenite, Jesu Christe 
Domine Deus, Agnus Dei, Filius patris 
Qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis 
Qui tollis peccata mundi suscipe deprecationem nostram 
Qui sedes ad dexteram patris miserere nobis 
Quoniam tu solus sanctus 
Tu solus Dominus 
Tu solus Altissimus, Jesu Christe 
Cum Sancto Spiritu in gloria Dei Patris.  
Amen.

Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born.
While shepherds kept their watching  
Over silent flocks by night  
Behold throughout the heavens  
There shone a holy light.
Go, tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born.
The shepherds feared and trembled  
When lo! above the earth  
Rang out the angels chorus  
That hailed the Savior's birth.
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born.
Down in a lowly manger  
The humble Christ was born  
And God sent us salvation 
That blessed Christmas morn.
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born.

Go tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and everywhere 
Go tell it on the mountain 
Our Jesus Christ is born.
When I was a seeker  
I sought both night and day 
I asked the Lord to help me 
And he showed me the way.
Go tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and everywhere 
Go tell it on the mountain 
Our Jesus Christ is born. 
He made me a watchman 
Upon a city wall 
And if I am a Christian 
I am the least of all. 
Go tell it on the mountain 
Over the hills and everywhere 
Go tell it on the mountain 
Our Jesus Christ is born. 

God rest ye merry, gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember, Christ, our Saviour  
Was born on Christmas day  
To save us all from Satan's power  
When we were gone astray  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy.
In Bethlehem in Israel  
This blessed Babe was born  
And laid within a manger  
Upon this blessed morn  
The which His Mother Mary  
Did nothing take in scorn  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy. 
From God our Heavenly Father  
A blessed Angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The Son of God by Name  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy.
"Fear not then," said the Angel  
"Let nothing you affright  
This day is born a Saviour  
Of a pure Virgin bright  
To free all those who trust in Him  
From Satan's power and might."  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy.
The shepherds at those tidings  
Rejoiced much in mind  
And left their flocks a-feeding  
In tempest, storm and wind  
And went to Bethlehem straightway  
The Son of God to find  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy.
And when they came to Bethlehem  
Where our dear Saviour lay  
They found Him in a manger  
Where oxen feed on hay  
His Mother Mary kneeling down  
Unto the Lord did pray  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy. 
Now to the Lord sing praises  
All you within this place  
And with true love and brotherhood  
Each other now embrace  
This holy tide of Christmas  
All other doth deface  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy. 

And the butter light of candlesticks  
Chases snowflakes off the bricks. 
The postman is shivering  
With packages he's delivering  
Ribbons pulled and try to hide  
Wishes waiting warm inside.
And everything looks better in gold and green  
The lights on the trees shining all through the city  
Are the prettiest I've ever seen  
And the world decides to sleep safe tonight.
The carolers, they sing noel  
Silent night and silver bells  
And all around you snow will fall  
Like confetti stars and paper dolls. 
And everything looks better in gold and green  
The lights on the trees in the eyes of our children  
Are the prettiest I've ever seen  
And the world decides to sleep safe tonight. 
The first noel  
The angels did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds  
In fields where they lay. 
Everything looks better in gold and green  
Everything looks better in gold and green  
Everything looks better in gold and green  
Everything looks better in gold and green  
Everything looks better  
Everything looks better.

Good Christian men, rejoice  
With heart and soul, and voice  
Give ye heed to what we say  
News! News! Jesus Christ is born today;  
Ox and ass before Him bow;   
And He is in the manger now  
Christ is born today!   
Christ is born today!
Good Christian men, rejoice  
With heart and soul and voice  
Now ye hear of endless bliss  
Joy! Joy! Jesus Christ was born for this!  
He has opened the heavenly door   
And man is blest forevermore  
Christ was born for this!   
Christ was born for this!
Good Christian men, rejoice  
With heart and soul and voice  
Now ye need not fear the grave  
Peace! Peace! Jesus Christ was born to save!  
Calls you one and calls you all  
To gain His everlasting hall.  
Christ was born to save!   
Christ was born to save

Good King Wenceslas looked out on the Feast of Stephen  
When the snow lay round about, deep and crisp and even.  
Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel  
When a poor man came in sight, gathering winter fuel.
"Hither, page, and stand by me, if you know it, telling  
Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling?"  
"Sire, he lives a good league hence, underneath the mountain  
Right against the forest fence, by Saint Agnes' fountain."
"Bring me food and bring me wine, bring me pine logs hither  
You and I will see him dine, when we bear them thither."  
Page and monarch, forth they went, forth they went together,  
Through the cold wind's wild lament and the bitter weather. 
"Sire, the night is darker now, and the wind blows stronger,  
Fails my heart, I know not how; I can go no longer."  
"Mark my footsteps, my good page, tread now in them boldly,  
You shall find the winter's rage freeze your blood less coldly." 
In his master's steps he trod, where the snow lay dinted  
Heat was in the very sod which the saint had printed.  
Therefore, Christian men, be sure, wealth or rank possessing,  
You who now will bless the poor shall yourselves find blessing.

Good people all, this Christmas time  
Consider well and bear in mind  
What our good God for us has done  
In sending His beloved Son.
With thankful heart we should pray  
To God with love this Christmas day  
In Bethlehem upon that morn  
There was a blessed Messiah born!
The night before that happy tide  
The noble virgin and her guide 
Were long time seeking up and down  
To find a lodging in the town.
But mark how all things came to pass  
From every door repelled, alas!  
As long foretold, their refuge all  
Was but an humble oxen's stall.
There were three wise men from afar  
Directed by a glorious star  
And on they wandered night and day  
Until they came where Jesus lay.
And when they came unto that place  
Where our beloved Messiah was  
They humbly cast them at His feet  
With gifts of gold and incense sweet.
Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep  
Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep  
To whom God's angels did appear  
Which put the shepherds in great fear.
"Prepare and go", the angels said  
"To Bethlehem, be not afraid  
For there you'll find, this happy morn  
A princely babe, sweet Jesus born".
With happy heart and joyful mind  
The shepherds went the babe to find  
And as God's angel had foretold  
They did our Saviour Christ behold.
Within a manger He was laid  
And by His side the virgin maid  
Attending on the Lord of life  
Who came on earth to end all strife.

Grandma got run over by a reindeer  
Walking home from our house Christmas eve.  
You can say there's no such thing as Santa 
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.
She'd been drinking too much eggnog, 
And we begged her not to go 
But she forgot her medication 
And she staggered out the door into the snow.
When we found her Christmas morning 
At the scene of the attack 
She had hoof-prints on her forehead 
And incriminating Claus marks on her back.
Grandma got run over by a reindeer 
Walking home from our house Christmas eve 
You can say there's no such thing as Santa 
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.
Now we're all so proud of Grandpa 
He's been taking this so well 
See him in there watching football, 
Drinking root beer 
And playing cards with Cousin Mel.
It's not Christmas without Grandma  
All the family's dressed in black 
And we just can't help but wonder 
Should we open up her gifts 
Or send them back? 
Send them back!
Grandma got run over by a reindeer 
Walking home from our house Christmas eve 
You can say there's no such thing as Santa 
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.
Now the goose is on the table 
And the pudding made of fig 
And the blue and silver candles 
That would just have matched 
The hair on grandma's wig.
I've warned all my friends and neighbors 
Better watch out for yourselves, 
They should never give a license 
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves.
Grandma got run over by a reindeer 
Walking home from our house Christmas eve 
You can say there's no such thing as Santa  
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

I wrote to you  
With childhood fantasies. 
Well, I'm all grown up now  
And still need help somehow  
I'm not a child  
But my heart still can dream.
So here's my lifelong wish  
My grown up Christmas list  
Not for myself  
But for a world in need.
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal the heart  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end   
This is my grown up Christmas list.
As children we believed  
The grandest sight to see  
Was something lovely  
Wrapped beneath the tree.
But heaven surely knows  
That packages and bows  
Can never heal  
A hurting human soul.
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end  
Oh, this is my grown up Christmas list.
What is this illusion  
Called the innocence of youth?  
Maybe only in our blind belief   
Can we ever find the truth.
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end, oh  
This is my grown up Christmas list  
This is my only life long wish  
This is my grown up Christmas list.

Blessed are you among women  
And blest is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. 
Holy Mary, Mother of God 
Pray for us sinners now 
And at the hour of death  
Amen.
Refrain: 
Gentle woman, quiet light 
Morning star, so strong and bright 
Gentle Mother, peaceful dove  
Teach us wisdom; teach us love.
You were chosen by the Father 
You were chosen for the Son 
You were chosen from all women  
And for woman  
Shining one.
Refrain: 
Gentle woman, quiet light 
Morning star, so strong and bright 
Gentle Mother, peaceful dove  
Teach us wisdom; teach us love.
Blessed are you among women 
Blest in turn all women, too 
Blessed they with peaceful spirits 
Blessed they with gentle hearts.
Refrain: 
Gentle woman, quiet light 
Morning star, so strong and bright 
Gentle Mother, peaceful dove  
Teach us wisdom; teach us love.

It's the holiday season   
And Santa Claus is coming back   
The Christmas snow is white on the ground   
When old Santa gets into town   
He'll be coming down the chimney, down   
Coming down the chimney, down.
It's the holiday season   
And Santa Claus has got a toy  
For every good girl and good little boy   
He's a great big bundle of joy   
He'll be coming down the chimney, down   
Coming down the chimney, down.
He'll have a big fat pack upon his back   
And lots of goodies for you and me   
So leave a peppermint stick for old St.Nick  
Hanging on the Christmas tree.
It's the holiday season   
With the whoop-de-do and hickory dock   
And don't forget to hang up your sock   
"Cause just exactly at 12 o'clock   
He'll be coming down the chimney   
Coming down the chimney   
Coming down the chimney, down! 
Happy Holiday

Look at the happiness in their eyes 
They're glad it's Christmas.
People carolin' into the night 
Where the snow is fallin'   
There are sleigh bells rides tonight 
We'll snuggle to a nice warm fire 
I'm glad it's Christmas.
But before the snow gets under way 
Think of how much love you wish to give today 
Then wonder why we can't give it all every day 
There is no reason, every season needs love.
People really need one another 
Men, women, boy, girl, sister and brother  
We wish to 
Wish happy holidays to you 
(Happy holidays, happy holidays) 
Happy holidays to you.
And for this holiday season celebration 
Let's lift our hands to the holy nation 
To say thank You, Father  
Happy Birthday to Your Son 
Happy holidays to you.
Hope is the strength we need 
Love is to share with men 
Peace is to be with everyone.
Happy holidays to you 
(Happy holidays, happy holidays) 
To you, yeah 
Happy holidays to you 
(Happy holidays, happy holidays) 
People really need one another 
Men, women, boy, girl, sister and brother  
We wish to 
Wish happy holidays to you 
(Happy holidays, happy holidays) 
Happy holidays to you 
We wish you happy holidays 
To you, to you, to you.

Maybe I'll move somewhere   
Maybe I'll get a car   
Maybe I'll drive so far   
They'll all lose track   
Me, I'll bounce right back.
Maybe I'll sleep real late   
Maybe I'll lose some weight   
Maybe I'll clear my junk   
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine.
Me, I'll be just   
Fine and Dandy   
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas   
I'm barely getting through tomorrow   
But still I won't let   
Sorrow bring me way down.
I'll be fine and dandy  
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas   
I'm barely getting through tomorrow   
But still I won't let   
Sorrow get me way down.
Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew   
Maybe I'll just lie low   
Maybe I'll hit the bars   
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn   
Me, I will go on.
Maybe I'll settle down   
Maybe I'll just leave town   
Maybe I'll have some fun   
Maybe I'll meet someone   
And make him mine. 
Me, I'll be just   
Fine and dandy   
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas   
I'm barely getting through tomorrow   
But still I won't let   
Sorrow bring me way down.   
I'll be fine and dandy   
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas   
I'm barely getting through tomorrow   
But still I won't let   
Sorrow bring me way down.
I'll be fine and dandy   
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas   
I'm barely getting through tomorrow   
But still I won't let   
Sorrow bring me way down.
'Cause I'll be fine   
(I'll be fine)   
Oh, I'll be fine.

I don't want to hear about your new boyfriend  
I don't want to hear about it all working out for you  
No, I don't want to hear it now.
I don't want to hear about your swinging new place  
I don't want to hear how everyone thinks its great  
I just want to sit in our apartment and hate you  
Yes, I will be hating you for Christmas.
You can have the Christmas tree  
Remember when we bought it at the store down the street?   
Remember when I found that cheesy color wheel?   
I don't want to think about the lights on your white skin  
No, I don't want to think about it.
I don't want to think about last year at your dad's  
You said it was the best sex that we both ever had  
I don't want to think about my face in your soft hair  
I will be hating you for Christmas.
I will be hating you for Christmas  
I will be hating you for Christmas  
I will be hating you for Christmas  
I will be hating you for Christmas  
I will be hating you for Christmas  
I will be hating you for Christmas  
I will be hating you for Christmas 
I must be losing my mind  
There's gotta be a better way to deal with the pain  
There's gotta be a better way to deal with the hate  
Wish that I could find some way to make you go away  
Wish that I could have a drink and make you fade  
I wish that I could have myself a drink and make you fade  
I wish that I could have a drink and make you go away  
Yeah, make you go away  
Wish that I could make you go away  
I will be hating you for Christmas  
Yeah, I will be hating you for Christmas  
Thanks for the Christmas card.

Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light 
From now on 
Our troubles will be out of sight.
Have yourself a merry little Christmas 
Make the Yuletide gay  
From now on  
Our troubles will be miles away.
Here we are as in olden days 
Happy golden days of yore 
Faithful friends who are dear to us 
Gather near to us once more.
Through the years  
We all will be together 
If the Fates allow 
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough 
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now.

He is born, the divine Christ child  
Play on the oboe and bagpipes merrily 
He is born, the divine Christ child 
Sing we all of the Saviour's birth.
Through long ages of the past 
Prophets have foretold his coming 
Through long ages of the past 
Now the time has come at last.
Oh, how lovely, oh, how pure 
Is this perfect child of heaven 
Oh, how lovely, oh, how pure 
Gracious gift of God, to man.  
Jesus, Lord of all the world 
Coming as a child among us 
Jesus, Lord of all the world 
Grant to us Thy heav'nly peace.  

Sin demanded justice 
At a price we could not pay; 
But God displayed his mercy 
The greatest gift of love 
When we could not reach heaven 
Heaven came to us.
Chorus: 
He made a way in a manger 
A way to the cross 
Messiah the promised 
Before time had begun; 
For God so loved this world 
Though he knew what love would cost 
He made a way in a manger 
To make a way to the cross.
In Bethlehem a stable 
Became a throne of grace 
As God himself our Savior 
Drew near to take our place; 
His mother smiled in wonder 
As shepherds stood in awe 
The sacrifice of heaven 
Lay sleeping in the straw.
Bridge: 
He is the life that died our death 
The precious Lord Jesus 
Laid down his sweet head.
Chorus: 
He made a way in a manger 
A way to the cross 
Messiah, the promised 
Before time had begun; 
For God so loved this world 
Though He knew what love would cost 
He made a way in a manger 
To make a way to the cross.
Away in a manger, no crib for his bed 
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head 
The stars in the sky looked down where He lay 
The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.

Hardly what she pictured 
In the prophecies of old 
It seemed almost impossible 
To think it could be true 
But as she pondered in her heart 
She knew. 
This was heaven's Child 
This was heaven's Child 
In an earthen vessel 
Wrapped in Glory, meek and mild 
Joseph wept with wonder 
As Mary sweetly smiled 
Because they knew 
This was heaven's Child 
The angels must have missed Him 
As they sang Him to sleep 
But they marveled at the promises 
This baby came to keep 
His Father must have felt at once 
Great sadness and great joy 
As He watched His little baby boy. 
This was heaven's Child 
This was heaven's Child 
In an earthen vessel 
Wrapped in Glory, meek and mild 
Joseph wept with wonder 
As Mary sweetly smiled 
Because they knew 
This was heaven's Child 
Mary's little baby boy 
Was Joseph's pride and joy 
Still they wished the world would see 
He was so much more. 
He was heaven's Child 
He was heaven's Child 
In an earthen stable 
Wrapped in glory, meek and mild 
Joseph wept with wonder 
As Mary sweetly smiled 
Because they knew 
This was heaven's Child. 
Because they knew 
This was heaven's Child.

Here comes Santa Claus  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Right down Santa Claus Lane  
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer  
Are pulling on the reins.
Bells are ringing, children singing 
All is merry and bright. 
Hang your stockings and say your prayers 
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight. 
Here comes Santa Claus 
Here comes Santa Claus 
Right down Santa Claus Lane 
He's got a bag that is filled with toys 
For the boys and girls again.
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle 
What a beautiful sight 
Jump in bed, cover up your head 
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.

Here we come a wassailing 
Among the leaves so green 
Here we come a wandering 
So fair to be seen.

And to you your wassail too

Of the best barley.

And God send you a happy New Year.

I'm running late  
I'm all alone  
Wishing I was home with you, baby  
She's got her way of making things okay  
And when she's not around  
When she's not around  
I'm going crazy  
We like to talk  
About the plans we make  
And things we say  
When we're together  
I hope for better weather this year  
But you my dear, need to know  
This year I want you alone. 
Ho ho hopefully  
This holiday will make us believe that  
We're exactly where we're supposed to be  
And we're ho ho hoping that we all come back  
And as a matter of fact I know  
We're exactly where we're supposed to be  
Together by this Christmas tree.
We go together   
Like the winter and this sweater   
And she makes me feel  
She makes me feel alive inside  
And when I look into her eyes   
I see the blue and green   
Like Christmas lights   
Like Christmas lights   
Oh, what a sight!  
She says I've got a way   
Of making everything okay   
She's not alone  
She's not alone and never will be   
Ho ho hopefully   
This year, I have you alone.
Ho ho hopefully  
This holiday will make us believe that  
We're exactly where we're supposed to be  
And we're ho ho hoping that we all come back  
And as a matter of fact I know  
We're exactly where we're supposed to be  
Together by this Christmas tree.
Baby I want you alone! 
Ho ho hopefully  
This holiday will make us believe that  
We're exactly where we're supposed to be  
And we're ho ho hoping that we all come back  
And as a matter of fact I know  
We're exactly where we're supposed to be  
Together by this Christmas tree.
Ooh  
Together just you and me  
Together by the Christmas tree. 

Have a holly, jolly Christmas  
It's the best time of the year  
I don't know if there'll be snow  
But have a cup of cheer.
Have a holly, jolly Christmas 
And when you walk down the street 
Say "Hello" to friends you know 
And everyone you meet.
Oh, ho, the mistletoe 
Hung where you can see 
Somebody waits for you 
Kiss her once for me.
Have a holly jolly Christmas 
And in case you didn't hear 
Oh by golly  
Have a holly jolly Christmas 
This year.

For the holidays  
'Cause no matter how far away you roam  
When you pine for the sunshine  
Of a friendly face  
For the holidays, you can't beat  
Home, sweet home.
I met a man who lives in Tennessee   
And he was headin' for Pennsylvania  
And some home made pumpkin pie  
From Pennsylvania folks a travelin' down  
To Dixie's sunny shore  
From Atlantic to Pacific, gee  
The traffic is terrific.
Oh, there's no place like home 
For the holidays  
'Cause no matter how far away you roam  
If you want to be happy  
In a million ways  
For the holidays, you can't beat  
Home, sweet home.

It's the same that appeared  
And the wise men revered   
When hope was born this night. 
Out upon the snowy fields  
There's a silent peace that heals  
And it echoes the grace  
Of our Savior's embrace 
Because hope was born this night. 
Glory to God in the highest  
Peace on Earth  
Goodwill toward men  
Let all of the world  
Sing the chorus of joy  
Because hope was born this night. 
I can hear the Christmas bells ringing  
As softly a church choir sings  
It's the song used to praise  
The Ancient of Days  
When hope was born this night.  
There are angels in this place  
And my heart resounded with the praise  
Like a shepherd so scared   
I'll rejoice and declare  
That hope was born this night. 
Glory to God in the highest  
Peace on Earth  
Goodwill toward men  
Let all of the world  
Sing the chorus of joy  
Because hope was born this night. 
Gloria  
Gloria  
Gloria  
Gloria! 
Glory to God in the highest  
Peace on Earth  
Goodwill toward men  
Let all of the world  
Sing the chorus of joy  
Because hope was born this night. 
I know that hope was born this night 
Because Christ was born this night.

How brightly beams the morning star!  
What sudden radiance from afar  
Doth glad us with its shining  
Thy word, Jesus, truly feeds us  
Rightly leads us, life bestowing 
Praise, O praise such love o'er flowing.
The ray of God that breaks our night  
And fills the darkened souls with light 
Who long for truth were pining 
Thy word, Jesus, truly feeds us  
Rightly leads us, life bestowing  
Praise, O praise such love o'er flowing.


Everybody's shopping, got no time for stopping 
It looks like Christmas is here.
So tell me, how do I wrap my heart up for Christmas? 
I wanna give it to you; 
Pretty bows and ribbons don't fit the gift I'm giving 
Your loving arms will have to do.
At first, I thought of giving you a pretty diamond ring 
Wore myself out shopping for a million other things; 
Finally decided on something you can't buy 
But how will I disguise it, so you will be surprised?
How do I wrap my heart up for Christmas? 
I wanna give it to you; 
Pretty bows and ribbons don't fit the gift I'm giving 
Your loving arms will have to do.
A gift of love was given to the world so long ago 
Laying in a manger, He was wrapped in swaddling clothes; 
And every year we celebrate and thank the Lord above 
And give to one another, our little gifts of love.
How do I wrap my heart up for Christmas? 
I wanna give it to you; 
Pretty bows and ribbons don't fit the gift I'm giving 
Your loving arms will have to do.
Pretty bows and ribbons don't fit the gift I'm giving 
Your loving arms will have to do.

How far is it to Bethlehem?  
Not very far. 
Shall we find the stable room 
Lit by a star?
Can we see the little Child?  
Is He within? 
If we lift the wooden latch 
May we go in? 
May we stroke the creatures there 
Ox, ass, or sheep? 
May we peep like them and see 
Jesus asleep?
If we touch His tiny hand 
Will He awake? 
Will He know we've come so far 
Just for His sake?
Great kings have precious gifts 
And we have naught 
Little smiles and little tears 
Are all we brought.
For all weary children 
Mary must weep 
Here, on His bed of straw 
Sleep, children, sleep.
God in His mother's arms 
Babes in the byre 
Sleep, as they sleep who find 
Their heart's desire.

'Twas in the moon of wintertime  
When all the birds had fled 
That mighty Gitchi Manitou 
Sent angel choirs instead 
Before their light the stars grew dim 
And wondering hunters heard the hymn.
Jesus your King is born 
Jesus is born 
In excelsis gloria.
Within a lodge of broken bark 
The tender babe was found 
A ragged robe of rabbit skin 
En-wrapped His beauty round 
But as the hunter braves drew nigh 
The angel song rang loud and high.
Jesus your King is born 
Jesus is born 
In excelsis gloria.
The earliest moon of wintertime 
Is not so round and fair 
As was the ring of glory 
On the helpless Infant there 
The chiefs from far before Him knelt 
With gifts of fox and beaver pelt.
Jesus your King is born 
Jesus is born 
In excelsis gloria.
O children of the forest free 
O seed of Manitou 
The holy Child of earth and Heav'n 
Is born today for you 
Come kneel before the radiant Boy 
Who brings you beauty, peace and joy.
Jesus your King is born 
Jesus is born 
In excelsis gloria.

I'm gonna pull, pull, pull, on his beard 
Pull, pull to see if it's real. 
I'm gonna tick, tick, tickle him on the tummy 
Because he laughs so funny 
He's so jolly and so fine 
When he comes around on Christmas time.
I'm gonna lasso Santa Claus 
And the reason is because 
I know a boy and girl; he never goes see 
He never brings 'em toys like he does to me.
I'm gonna pop, pop Santa Claus 
With my water pistol gun, squirt, squirt 
And then I'll take his bags of toys and run 
And bring to all the kids who don't have none.
I'm gonna lasso Santa Claus 
And I know just why because 
I'm gonna pull, pull, pull, on his beard 
Pull, pull, to see if it's real.
I'm gonna tick, tick, tickle him on the tummy 
Because he laughs so funny 
He's so jolly and so fine 
When he comes around on Christmas time.
I'm gonna lasso Santa Claus 
And the reason is because 
I know a boy and girl; he never goes see 
He never brings 'em toys like he does to me.
I'm gonna pop, pop Santa Claus 
With my water pistol gun bang, bang 
And then I'll take his bags of toys and run 
And bring to all the kids who don't have none.
Merry Christmas!

I'm walking backwards for Christmas, 
It's the only thing for me.
I've tried walking sideways, 
And walking to the front, 
But people just look at me, 
And say, "It's a publicity stunt."
I'm walking backwards for Christmas, 
To prove that, I love you.
An immigrant lad, loved an Irish colleen 
From Dublin Galway Bay 
He longed for her arms 
But she spurned his charms 
And sailed o'er the foam away.
She left the lad by himself, on his own 
All alone, a-sorrowing 
And sadly he dreamed  
Or at least that's the way it seemed 
Buddy, that an angel quieted him 
An angel quieted the same. 
I'm walking backwards for Christmas 
Across the Irish Sea 
I'm walking backwards for Christmas 
It's the finest thing for me.
And so I've tried walking sideways 
And walking to the front 
But people just laughed, and said, 
"It's a publicity stunt".
So I'm walking backwards for Christmas 
To prove that I love you.

Long ago  
There were shepherds in fields 
Or at least this is how  
The story goes 
The story goes 
Woman with Child  
And an inn with no room 
Born in a manger  
For telling it too 
This is how  
The story goes 
But it is more than a fable 
And it is more than a fairytale 
And more than my mind can conceive. 
I believe  
The wise men saw  
The Baby Boy  
The angels called  
The Son of God  
Heaven's Child 
The great I am  
Born to take away my sins  
Through nailed pierced hands  
Emmanuel has come  
I believe. 
Two thousand years  
Still the story lives on  
God's gift to us  
Sent to earth  
Wrapped in flesh  
His only Son  
His only Son  
And the heartbeat of heaven  
Confounded our wisdom  
But it's still the simple truth  
That sets me free. 
I believe  
The wise men saw  
The Baby Boy  
The angels called  
The Son of God  
Heaven's child 
The great I am  
Born to take away my sins  
Through nailed pierced hands  
Emmanuel has come  
I believe. 
Precious Child  
How can it be  
That God's great plan  
For history  
Would send You  
To the lonely tree  
That You would come  
For one like me? 
I believe  
In a cross  
I believe  
He came for one  
He came for all  
Heaven's Child  
Became a Man 
Gave his life for me  
In spite of all I am 
I believe 
I believe  
Oh I believe 
Christmas lives in me  
I believe.

But instead it just kept on raining   
A veil of tears for the virgin birth  
I remember one Christmas morning  
A winter's light and a distant choir  
And the peal of a bell   
And that Christmas tree smell  
And eyes full of tinsel and fire.
They sold me a dream of Christmas   
They sold me a silent night   
And they told me a fairy story   
'Till I believed in the Israelite   
I believed in Father Christmas   
I looked to the sky with excited eyes   
'Till I woke with a yawn   
In the first light of dawn   
And I saw him through his disguise. 
I wish you a hopeful Christmas   
I wish you a brave New Year   
All anguish pain and sadness   
Leave your heart   
And let your road be clear   
They said there'll be snow at Christmas   
They said there'll be peace on Earth   
Hallelujah Noel   
Be it heaven or hell   
The Christmas we get, we deserve.

I believe there's always hope  
When all seems lost,   
And I believe in Santa Claus.
I believe in Santa Claus  
I'll tell you why I do   
'Cause I believe that dreams  
And plans and wishes   
Can come true   
I believe in miracles  
I believe in magic too   
Oh, I believe in Santa Claus   
And I believe in you.
I believe in family  
In country and in smiles   
I believe in turnin' negatives   
To positives in life   
I believe in lookin' farther up   
The farther down we get   
I believe when someone hurts us   
We should forgive and forget.
And I believe in Santa Claus   
I believe in Santa Claus   
I believe love should prevail at any cost   
And I believe in Santa Claus.
I believe in saying what you mean   
And meaning what you say   
I believe a better attitude   
Can make a better way   
And I believe in viewing life   
As a journey that we're on   
And lookin' at our troubles   
As another stepping stone.
And I believe that everything in life   
Is what it's meant to be   
I believe there is a God somewhere   
Although he's hard to see   
I believe I am   
So therefore, I should do all that I can   
To be a better piece  
In the puzzle of God's plan. 
And I believe in Santa Claus  
I believe in Santa Claus   
I believe there's always hope   
When all seems lost   
And I believe in Santa Claus.
Let the little children sing it:   
I believe in Santa Claus  
I believe in Santa Claus   
I believe in Santa Claus   
I believe in Santa Claus.
Let the whole world sing it with us:    
I believe in Santa Claus  
I believe in Santa Claus   
I believe in Santa Claus   
I believe in Santa Claus.
Let the whole world sing it with us:    
I believe in Santa Claus  
I believe in Santa Claus   
I believe in Santa Claus   
I believe in Santa Claus.

And how I know I'll make it through 
They look at me and frown 
And like to drive me from this town 
They don't want me around 
'Cause I believe in you.
They show me to the door 
They say "Don't come back no more" 
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to 
And I, I walk out on my own 
A thousand miles from home 
But I don't feel alone 
'Cause I believe in you.
I believe in you  
Even through the tears and the laughter  
I believe in you   
Even though we be apart  
I believe in you   
Even on the morning after  
Oh, when the dawn is nearing  
Oh, when the night is disappearing  
Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart.
Don't let me drift too far  
Keep me where you are  
Where I will always be renewed  
And that which you've given me today  
Is worth more than I could pay  
And no matter what they say  
I believe in you.
I believe in you   
When winter turn to summer  
I believe in you   
When white turns to black  
I believe in you   
Even though I be outnumbered  
Oh, though the earth may shake me  
Oh, though my friends forsake me  
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
Don't let me change my heart  
Keep me set apart  
From all the plans they do pursue  
And I, I don't mind the pain  
Don't mind the driving rain  
I know I will sustain  
'Cause I believe in you.



And the greatest gift  
Is learning to forgive 
We will have the best time  
We ever knew 
If you forgive me 
And I forgive you. 
I don't want to light a fire 
Unless it will warm your heart 
I'm playing no holiday songs 
I need you to sing your part 
And baby, if I could have just  
One wish come true 
I don't wanna spend  
One more Christmas without you.
It's so hard to believe 
We're staring at the end 
When all we think about  
Is starting up again 
Starting up again  
Whatever we lost 
When we were apart 
We'll find it all  
Alone in the dark.
I don't want to light a fire 
Unless it will warm your heart 
I'm playing no holiday songs 
I need you to sing your part 
And baby if I could have just  
One wish come true 
I don't wanna spend  
One more Christmas without you.
There's nothing more  
That I want from you 
Than to lie together  
And stay here forever with you 
There's no one I ever knew  
That I wanted to spend Christmas with  
More than you 
More than you.
I don't want to light a fire 
Unless it will warm your heart 
I'm playing no holiday songs 
I need you to sing your part 
And baby if I could have  
Just one wish come true 
I don't wanna spend 
One more Christmas without you.
I don't want to light a fire 
Unless it will warm your heart 
I'm playing no holiday songs 
I need you to sing your part 
And baby if I could have  
Just one wish come true 
I don't wanna spend 
One more Christmas 
I don't wanna spend 
One more Christmas 
I don't wanna spend 
One more Christmas 
Without you.

I heard the bells on Christmas Day  
Their old familiar carols play 
And wild and sweet the words repeat  
Of Peace on earth, good will to men. 
I thought how, as the day had come  
The belfries of all Christendom  
Had rolled along the unbroken song  
Of Peace on earth, good will to men. 
Till ringing, singing on its way 
The world revolved from night to day 
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime 
Of peace on earth, good will to men.
And in despair, I bowed my head  
"There is no peace on earth", I said,  
"For hate is strong and mocks the song 
Of Peace on earth, good will to men".
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep 
"God is not dead, nor doth He sleep 
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail 
With Peace on earth, good will to men".

And I wish you were closer to me  
Every song they play this time of year  
Every melody that I hear 
Every minute I wish  
I wish, you were near. 
Something's missin'  
Must be you  
So I listen when the bells start ringin'  
My heart start singin'. 
I listen to the bells  
And they make remember  
When we were so in love  
It was only last year 
This time in December  
I listen to the bells  
And I reminisce  
I hear those Christmas bells  
But I never knew  
That I could miss you like this. 
Love the lights  
And everything under the tree  
Friends come around  
They have a good time  
But it's not a party for me  
Call up Santa  
Tell him that I've been blue  
Tell him it's hard for me  
It's been a blue holiday 
Cause I'm missin' you. 
I keep wishin'  
Wondering if you'll think of me  
So I listen when the bells start ringin'  
My heart start singin'. 
Something's missin' 
Must be you  
So I listen when the bells start ringin'  
My heart start singin'.


I love You more 
More than the sweetest song I sing 
I love You more 
More than the Christmas bells that ring 
I love You more, my Lord.
More than a star filled summer's night 
I love You more 
More awe than viewing a wondrous sight 
I love You more 
More than the Christmas cards I write 
I love You more, my Lord.
More than the days, more than the nights 
More than seasons and reasons for every life 
More is my love for Jesus Christ 
And my God who made it all.
More than the autumn's falling leaves 
I love You more 
More than snowflakes dancing in the breeze 
I love You more 
Much more than Santa and Christmas trees 
I love You more, my Lord.
More than the days, more than the nights 
More than seasons and reasons for every life 
More is my love for Jesus Christ 
And my God who made it all.
More than the autumn's falling leaves 
I love You more 
More than snowflakes dancing in the breeze 
I love You more 
Much more than Santa and Christmas trees 
I love You more, my Lord.
With every single breath of life You give me 
I love You more 
More than I love the first of spring 
I love You more 
More than the sweetest song I sing 
I love You more 
Lord, I love You more.

I found true love and it's here to stay 
Chapel bells are gonna ring in May 
I met an angel on Christmas day.
24th of December 
It was a cold and snowy night 
I can still remember 
Gazing at the stars and the moonlight. 
Fell asleep on the sofa bed 
Dreams of Christmas in my head 
I awoke to my surprise 
There he was right before my eyes.
Listen up to what I gotta say 
I found true love and it's here to stay 
Chapel bells are gonna ring in May 
I met an angel on Christmas day.
I was stuffing the stockings 
And hanging tinsel on the tree 
When I heard a knocking 
I opened the door in time to see 
Carolers and silver bells 
I saw his face, that's when I fell 
He was there bent on one knee 
Santa sent him just for me.
Listen up to what I gotta say 
I found true love and it's here to stay 
Chapel bells are gonna ring in May 
I met an angel on Christmas day.
Yeah, yeah.
I know this love will grow 
When flowers bloom in early spring 
I'll be his bride, I'll wear his ring.
If you're looking for a angel 
Who is gonna make your every dream come true 
Just write an letter saying, "Santa hey 
I need an angel next Christmas day". 

Yeah, ooh baby.
Listen up to what I gotta say 
I found true love and it's here to stay 
Chapel bells are gonna ring in May 
I met an angel on Christmas day.
Listen up to what I gotta say 
I found true love and it's here to stay 
Chapel bells are gonna ring in May 
Chapel bells are gonna ring in May 
I met an angel on Christmas day.
Listen up to what I gotta say 
True love and it's all day 
I met an angel on Christmas day.
Hey hey hey yeah 
On Christmas day 
Ohohohohhooooo.
Oh baby!


Presents are wrapped  
Under the tree 
Is there one for me?
I only want you for Christmas, baby 
I don't need nothing else 
I only want you for Christmas, baby 
Tie a ribbon 'round yourself  
Oh, tie a ribbon 'round yourself.

I had a train too.

And I pray, I really pray on Christmas  
He'll get me through another day  
He'll get me through another day...

New Year's is a lot of noise 
And Arbor Day's a pest! 
Halloween's a horror 
But I guess I must confess 
That I really don't hate Christmas!
You see, Flag Day is infernal 
April Fool's is just a bore 
Mardi Gras a waste 
Unless you own a candy store 
All these other holidays 
I can admit that I abhor 
But I really don't hate Christmas.
Now it isn't that I like it 
At the most I feel ambivalence! 
But should I really just destroy it? 
I'll admit that I'm still on the fence 
It makes me tense!
From the evil scientist community 
I'm sure to get ejected 
But for Christmas, I can seem to summon 
Any true invective 
Because what is there to hate? 
I mean it's really so subjective! 
No, I really don't hate Christmas.
I hate puppy dogs and kittens 
I hate flowers in the spring 
I even hate the sunshine 
And the birdies when they sing 
I can work up animosity for almost anything 
Tell me, why I don't hate Christmas? 
Though my childhood was atrocious 
Christmas never was that bad, you see! 
So, the best that I can muster 
Is complete and total apathy 
What's wrong with me?
How can I prove 
That I am an evil villain worth his salt? 
When with a holiday so jolly 
I can't even find a fault? 
If I didn't feel ambiguous 
I'd launch a big assault! 
But I really don't hate Christmas!
No, I really 
No, I really don't hate Christmas!
I have an intense burning indifference!

Christmas toys all over the place  
Little Johnny wears a funny smile on his face  
Johnny has a secret and the secret he must share  
He wants to tell somebody, so he tells his teddy bear:
"I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus 
Underneath the mistletoe last night 
She didn't see me creep 
Down the stairs to have a peep 
She thought that I was tucked up 
In my bedroom, fast asleep."
"Then, I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus 
Underneath his beard so snowy white 
Oh, what a laugh it would have been 
If Daddy had only seen 
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night."

I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day  
I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas Day in the morning.
And what was in those ships all three  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?  
And what was in those ships all three  
On Christmas Day in the morning?
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day  
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there  
On Christmas Day in the morning.
Pray, wither sailed those ships all three  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?  
Pray, wither sailed those ships all three  
On Christmas Day in the morning?
Oh, they sailed into Bethlehem  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day  
Oh, they sailed into Bethlehem  
On Christmas Day in the morning.
And all the bells on earth shall ring  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day  
And all the bells on earth shall ring  
On Christmas Day in the morning.
And all the Angels in Heaven shall sing  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day  
And all the Angels in Heaven shall sing  
On Christmas Day in the morning.
And all the souls on earth shall sing  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day  
And all the souls on earth shall sing  
On Christmas Day in the morning.
Then let us all rejoice again  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day  
Then let us all rejoice again  
On Christmas Day in the morning.

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas  
Only a hippopotamus will do  
Don't want a doll, no dinky Tinker Toy 
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy.

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas 
I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do you? 
He won't have to use our dirty chimney flue 
Just bring him through the front door 
That's the easy thing to do.
I can see me now on Christmas morning 
Creeping down the stairs 
Oh what joy and what surprise 
When I open up my eyes 
To see a hippo hero standing there.
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas 
Only a hippopotamus will do 
No crocodiles, no rhinoceroses 
I only like hippopotamuses 
And hippopotamuses like me too.
Mom says the hippo would eat me up, but then 
Teacher says a hippo is a vegetarian 
There's lots of room for him in our two car garage 
I'd feed him there and wash him there and give him his massage.
I can see me now on Christmas morning 
Creeping down the stairs 
Oh what joy and what surprise 
When I open up my eyes 
To see a hippo hero standing there.
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas 
Only a hippopotamus will do 
No crocodiles or rhinoceroseses 
I only like hippopotamuseses 
And hippopotamuses like me too.

I'm dreaming tonight  
Of a place I love  
Even more than I usually do 
And although I know 
It's a long road back 
I promise you.
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
Please have snow and mistletoe 
And presents on the tree.
Christmas Eve will find me 
Where the love light gleams 
I'll be home for Christmas 
If only in my dreams.
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
Please have snow and mistletoe 
And presents on the tree.
Christmas Eve will find me 
Where the love light gleams 
I'll be home for Christmas 
If only in my dreams.

Trim the tree and wrap the presents
Turn the Christmas music on  
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on.
I've traveled around this country 
Crossed the waters deep and wide   
Made lots of friends and memories 
Brought joy to other's lives   
It's Christmas time again 
Another year has come and gone   
And I can't keep from wonderin' 
How the old folks are at home. 
I'll be home with bells on   
I'll be home with bells on   
Trim the tree and wrap the presents 
Turn the Christmas music on   
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on.
When the snow is on the meadow
And the sleigh bells jingle bright   
And the kids are singing jingle bells 
Around the Christmas lights   
As daddy stokes the fire 
And mama puts the turkey on   
There ain't nothing going 
To slow me down this Christmas 
I'll be home. 
I'll be home with bells on   
I'll be home with bells on   
Trim the tree and wrap the presents 
Turn the Christmas music on   
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on.

He's put a great big smile on somebody's face   
If you jump into your bed  
And you cover up your head  
Don't you lock the doors  
You know that sweet Santa Claus is on the way.
Well, I wish it could be Christmas everyday  
When the kids start singing 
And the band begins to play  
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas everyday  
Let the bells ring out for Christmas.
When we're skating in the park  
If the storm cloud paints it dark  
Then, your rosy cheeks are gonna light my merry way   
Now the frosticles appear  
And they've frozen up my beard  
And so we'll lie by the fire  
Til the sleet simply melts them all away.
Well, I wish it could be Christmas everyday  
When the kids start singing 
And the band begins to play  
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas everyday  
Let the bells ring out for Christmas.
When the snowman brings the snow   
Well, he just might like to know   
He's put a great big smile on somebody's face.  
So, if Santa brings that sleigh   
All along the Milky Way   
I'll sign my name on the rooftop in the snow  
Then he may decide to stay.
Well, I wish it could be Christmas everyday  
When the kids start singing 
And the band begins to play  
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas everyday  
Let the bells ring out for Christmas.
Okay you lot, take it.
Well, I wish it could be Christmas everyday  
When the kids start singing
And the band begins to play  
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas everyday  
Let the bells ring out for Christmas.
Why don't you give your love, it's Christmas? 
When the snowman brings the snow  
When the snowman brings the snow  
When the snowman brings the snow  
When the snowman...

I wonder as I wander out under the sky  
How Jesus the Saviour did come for to die 
For poor on'ry people like you and like I 
I wonder as I wander out under the sky. 
When Mary birthed Jesus 'twas in a cow's stall 
With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all 
But high from God's heaven, a star's light did fall 
And the promise of ages it then did recall. 
If Jesus had wanted for any wee thing 
A star in the sky or a bird on the wing 
Or all of God's Angels in heaven to sing 
He surely could have it, 'cause he was the King.
I wonder as I wander out under the sky  
How Jesus the Saviour did come for to die 
For poor on'ry people like you and like I 
I wonder as I wander out under the sky.

Cause joy is something they don't bring me.
My girlfriend is by my side  
From the roof are hanging sickles of ice  
Their whiny voices get irritating  
It's Christmas time again.
So I stand with a dead smile on my face  
Wondering how much of my time they'll waste  
Oh god, I hate these Satan's helpers.
And then I guess I must've snapped  
Because I grabbed a baseball bat  
And made them all run for shelter.
It's Christmas time again  
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand all year  
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer  
You people scare me  
Please stay away from my home  
If you don't wanna get beat down  
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone.
Well, I guess it's not cool to freak on Christmas Eve  
Cause the cops came and arrested me  
They had an unfair advantage.  
And even though the jail didn't have a tree  
Christmas came a night early  
Cause a guy named Bubba unwrapped my package. 
It's Christmas time again  
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand all year  
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer  
You people scare me  
Please stay away from my home  
If you don't wanna get beat down  
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone.
I won't be home  
I won't be home for Christmas  
I won't be home  
I won't be home for Christmas. 

I'll go in the red like a knucklehead 
Cuz I'll squander all my pay.
Oh, I yust go nuts at Christmas 
Shopping sure drives me berserk 
On the day before, I rush in a store 
Like a pure bewildered yerk.
I look at nightgowns for my wife 
Those black ones trimmed in red 
But I won't know her size and so 
She'll get a carpet sweeper instead.
Oh I yust go nuts at Christmas 
When each kid hangs up his sock 
It's a time for kids to flip their lids 
While their papa goes in hock.
On the night before Christmas 
It's still in the house 
My family is sleeping 
So I'm quiet like a mouse.
I look at my watch and midnight is near 
I think I'll sneak off for a cold glass of beer 
Down at the corner the crowd is so merry 
I end up by drinking about 12 Tom and Yerry.
I get to bed late and gee whiz how I'm sleeping 
When on to my bed those darn kids they come leaping 
They sit on my face and they yump on my belly 
And I'm quivering all over like a bowl full of yelly.
They scream "Merry Christmas", and my poor wife and me 
We stumble downstairs and she lights up the tree 
My head is exploding, my mouth tastes like a pickle 
I step on a skate and fall on a tricycle.
Yust before Christmas dinner I relax to a point 
Then relatives start swarming all over the yoint 
On Christmas I hug and I kiss my wife's mother 
The rest of the year we don't speak to each other.
After dinner my Aunt and my wife's Uncle Louie 
Get into an argument; they're both awful screwy  
Then all my wife's family say Louie is right 
And my goofy relations, they yoin in the fight. 
Back in the corner the radio is playing 
And over the racket, Gabriel Heater is saying 
"Peace on earth everybody and good will toward men" 
And yust at that moment someone slugs Uncle Ben.
They all run outside whooping so the neighbors will hear 
Oh, I'm so glad Merry Christmas comes yust once a year.
Oh, I yust go nuts at Christmas 
But I still have lots of fun 
Yust the same as you, I enyoy it too.
Merry Christmas Everyone!

They ring out to tell the world 
That this is the season of cheer.
I hear a choir 
Singing sweetly somewhere 
And a glow fills my heart 
I'm in peace with the world 
As the sound of their singing fills the air.
Oh, why can't every day be like Christmas? 
Why can't that feeling go on endlessly? 
For, if everyday could be just like Christmas 
What a wonderful world this would be!
I hear a child 
Telling Santa what to bring 
And the smile upon his tiny face 
Is worth more to me than anything.
Oh, why can't every day be like Christmas? 
Why can't that feeling go on endlessly? 
For, if everyday could be just like Christmas 
What a wonderful world this would be!

It's the coldest time of winter 
And I shiver when I see the fallin' snow.
If we make it through December 
I got plans of bein' in a warmer town, come summer time 
Maybe even California 
If we make it through December, we'll be fine.
I got laid off down at the factory 
And their timings not the greatest in the world 
Heaven knows I been workin' hard 
I wanted Christmas to be right for daddy's girl.
Now, I don't mean to hate December 
It's meant to be the happy time of year 
And why my little girl don't understand 
Why daddy can't afford no Christmas here.
If we make it through December 
Every things gonna be all right, I know 
It's the coldest time of winter 
And I shiver when I see the fallin' snow.
If we make it through December 
I got plans of bein' in a warmer town, come summer time 
Maybe even California 
If we make it through December, we'll be fine.

In dulci jubilo  
Let us our homage show  
Our heart's joy reclineth  
In praesepio  
And like a bright star shineth  
Matris in gremio  
Alpha es et O! 
O Jesu parvule,  
My heart is sore for Thee  
Hear me, I beseech Thee  
O puer optime  
My praying let it reach Thee!  
O princeps gloriae  
Trahe me post te.
O patris caritas!  
O Nati lenitas!  
Deeply were we stained  
Per nostra crimina  
But Thou for us hast gained  
Coelorum gaudia  
Qualis gloria!
Ubi sunt gaudia,  
If that they be not there?  
There are angels singing   
Nova cantica;  
And there the bells are ringing  
In Regis curia  
O that we were there! 

Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;  
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,  
In the bleak midwinter, long ago.
Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;  
Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign  
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed  
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.
Enough for Him, Whom cherubim, worship night and day,  
Breast full of milk, and a manger full of hay;  
Enough for Him, Whom angels fall before,  
The ox and ass and camel which adore.
Angels and archangels may have gathered there,  
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;  
But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,  
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss.
What can I give Him, poor as I am?  
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;  
If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;  
Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart.

For His bed a cattle stall  
Oxen lowing, little knowing  
Christ the Babe, is Lord of all.  
Swift are winging angels singing  
Noels ringing, tidings bringing:  
Christ the Babe, is Lord of all.
Flocks were sleeping, shepherds keeping  
Vigil till the morning new  
Saw the glory, heard the story  
Tidings of a Gospel true.  
Thus rejoicing, free from sorrow  
Praises voicing, greet the morrow:  
Christ the Babe was born for you.

That glorious song of old 
From angels bending near the earth 
To touch their harps of gold 
"Peace on the earth, goodwill to men 
From heaven's all gracious King!" 
The world in solemn stillness lay 
To hear the angels sing.
Still through the cloven skies they come 
With peaceful wings unfurled 
And still their heavenly music floats 
O'er all the weary world 
Above its sad and lowly plains 
They bend on hovering wing 
And ever o'er its Babel sounds 
The blessed angels sing.
Yet with the woes of sin and strife 
The world has suffered long 
Beneath the angel-strain have rolled 
Two thousand years of wrong 
And man, at war with man, hears not 
The love-song that they bring 
O hush the noise, ye men of strife 
And hear the angels sing.
And yet, beneath life's crushing load 
Whose forms are bending low 
Who toil along the climbing way 
With painful steps and slow 
Take heart, for comfort, love, and hope 
come swiftly on the wing 
O rest beside the weary road 
And hear the angels sing.
For lo, the days are hastening on 
By prophets, bards foretold 
When with the ever-circling years 
Comes round the age of gold 
When peace shall over all the earth 
Its ancient splendors fling 
And the whole world send back the song 
Which now the angels sing.

I watch the snowflakes  
Falling from the sky  
Then I get lost in memories 
The time we tried to build a snowman  
The time we tried to count the stars  
Its crazy how we didn't know that  
That we'd ever be apart. 
I can hear the music playing 
See the lights upon the tree 
I can feel the joy in every soul 
But for me its incomplete 
And I try my best to play the part  
But no matter what I do 
No, it just don't feel like Christmas  
Without you 
You, you, you oooh.

Another tear, another regret  
Boy, that your so far away  
Can it be, that it was only last year   
We shared that Christmas day? 
Remember when we took the sleigh ride?   
Remember singing by the fire?   
There's too much thats in the daylight  
I keep reliving you and I. 

I can hear the music playing 
See the lights upon the tree 
I can feel the joy in every soul 
But for me its incomplete 
And I try my best to play the part  
But no matter what I do 
No, it just don't feel like Christmas  
Without you 
You, you, you oooh.
Time to try to build a snowman  
The time we try to count the stars   
Its crazy how we didn't know that   
That we'd ever be apart! 

I can hear the music playing 
See the lights upon the tree 
I can feel the joy in every soul 
But for me its incomplete 
And I try my best to play the part  
But no matter what I do 
It just don't feel like Christmas  
No, it just don't feel like Christmas  
Without you 
You, you, you oooh.

The magic in the frosty air  
That feeling everywhere. 
It must have been the pretty lights  
That glistened in the silent night  
It may be just the stars so bright  
That shined above you 
Our first Christmas  
More than we'd be dreaming of  
Ah, Saint Nicholas had his fingers crossed  
That we would fall in love! 
It could have been the holiday,  
The midnight ride upon sleigh  
The countryside all dressed in white  
The crazy snowball fight! 
It could have been the steeple bell  
That wrapped us up in its spell  
It only took one kiss to know  
It must have been the mistletoe! 
Our first Christmas more than we'd be dreaming of  
Ah, St. Nicholas must have know that kiss  
Would lead to all of this!! 
It must have been the mistletoe  
The lazy fire, the falling snow  
The magic in the frosty air  
That made me love you! 
On Christmas eve, our wish came true  
That I would fall in love with you  
It only took one kiss to know 
It must have been the mistletoe!  
It must have been the mistletoe!  
It must have been the mistletoe!

Earth lay sleeping  
Sleeping calm and still  
Then in a cattle shed  
In a manger bed  
A boy was born  
King of all the world. 

Chorus: 
And all the angels sang for Him  
The bells of heaven rang for Him 
For a boy was born  
King of all the world.  
And all the angels sang for Him  
The bells of heaven rang for Him  
For a boy was born  
King of all the world. 
Soon the shepherds came that way  
Where the baby lay  
And were kneeling  
Kneeling by His side  
And their hearts believed again  
For the peace of men  
For a boy was born  
King of all the world.
Chorus: 
And all the angels sang for Him  
The bells of heaven rang for Him 
For a boy was born  
King of all the world.  
And all the angels sang for Him  
The bells of heaven rang for Him  
For a boy was born  
King of all the world. 

And late one winter night 
He knelt by her 
As she gave birth 
But it wasn't his child 
It wasn't his child.
Yet still he took him as his own 
And as he watched him grow 
It brought him joy 
But it wasn't his child 
It wasn't his child.
But like a father  
He was strong and kind 
And I believe he did his best 
It wasn't easy for him 
But he did all could 
His son was different 
From the rest 
It wasn't his child 
It wasn't his child.
And when the boy  
Became a man 
He took his father's hand 
And soon the world 
Would all know why 
It wasn't his child 
It wasn't his child.
But like his father  
He was strong and kind 
And I believe he did his best 
It wasn't easy for him 
But he did all could 
He grew up  
With his hands in wood 
And he died  
With his hands in wood 
He was God's child 
He was God's child.
He was her man 
She was his wife 
And late one night 
He knelt by her 
As she gave birth 
But it wasn't his child 
It was God's child.

Ev'rywhere you go  
Take a look in the five-and-ten  
Glistening once again  
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Toys in ev'ry store  
But the prettiest sight to see  
Is the holly that will be  
On your own front door.
A pair of hop-along boots  
And a pistol that shoots  
Is the wish of Barney and Ben  
Dolls that will talk 
And will go for a walk  
Is the hope of Janice and Jen  
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait  
For school to start again.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Ev'rywhere you go   
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel  
One in the park as well  
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Soon the bells will start  
And the thing that will make them ring  
Is the carol that you sing  
Right within your heart.

Please make my wish come true 
Why can't we join hands around one tree?  
Let live and let it be 
Make Christmas last forever. 
When Santa's flying in his magic sleigh 
Goes all around the world in just a day 
From the North Pole to the Southern tip 
He makes his trip with gifts to give away 
Hear him say: 
"It's Christmas, all over the world tonight 
It's Christmas, all over the world." 
All my life, I learned if I was good  
And did everything I should 
My dreams would all come true 
I can see a special time  
When we join hands around one tree 
And Christmas lasts forever. 
When Santa's flying in his magic sleigh 
Goes all around the world in just a day 
From the North Pole to the Southern tip 
He makes his trip with gifts to give away 
Hear him say:
"It's Christmas, all over the world tonight 
It's Christmas, all over the world."

And everyone telling you "Be of good cheer"  
It's the most wonderful time of the year.
It's the hap-happiest season of all 
With those holiday greetings and gay, happy meetings  
When friends come to call  
It's the hap-happiest season of all.
There'll be parties for hosting  
Marshmallows for toasting  
And caroling out in the snow  
There'll be scary ghost stories  
And tales of the glories of  
Christmases long, long ago.
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
There'll be much mistletoeing  
And hearts will be glowing  
When loved ones are near  
It's the most wonderful time of the year.

Holy wisdom, love most bright  
Drawn by Thee, our souls aspiring  
Soar to uncreated light.  
Word of God, our flesh that fashioned  
With the fire of life impassioned  
Striving still to truth unknown  
Soaring, dying round Thy throne.
Through the way where hope is guiding  
Hark, what peaceful music rings  
Where the flock, in Thee confiding  
Drink of joy from deathless springs.  
Their's is beauty's fairest pleasure  
Their's is wisdom's holiest treasure.  
Thou dost ever lead Thine own  
In the love of joys unknown.
German: Jesus Bleibet Meine Freude 
Jesus bleibet meine Freude 
Meines Herzens Trost und Saft 
Jesus wehret allem Leide 
Er ist meines Lebens Kraft 
Meiner Augen Lust und Sonne 
Meiner Seele Schatz und Wonne 
Darum lass' ich Jesum nicht 
Aus dem Herzen und Gesicht.
Wohl mir, dass ich Jesum habe 
O wie feste halt' ich ihn 
Dass er mir mein Herze labe 
Wenn ich krank und traurig bin 
Jesum hab' ich, der mich liebet 
Und sich mir zu eigen giebet 
Ach drum lass' ich Jesum nicht 
Wenn mir gleich mein Herze bricht.

Laden with fruit and always green 
The trees of nature fruitless be 
Compared with Christ the apple tree. 
His beauty doth all things excel 
By faith I know, but ne'er can tell 
The glory which I now can see 
In Jesus Christ the apple tree.
For happiness I long have sought 
And pleasure dearly I have bought 
I missed of all; but now I see 
'Tis found in Christ the apple tree.
I'm weary with my former toil 
Here I will sit and rest awhile 
Under the shadow I will be 
Of Jesus Christ the apple tree.
This fruit doth make my soul to thrive 
It keeps my dying faith alive 
Which makes my soul in haste to be 
With Jesus Christ the apple tree.

On a snow white Christmas Eve 
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy  
With the baby in the backseat 
Fifty miles to go  
And she was running low  
On faith and gasoline.
It'd been a long hard year 
She had a lot on her mind  
And she didn't pay attention 
She was going way too fast 
Before she knew it  
She was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass 
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes 
She didn't even have time to cry 
She was so scared 
She threw her hands up in the air.
Jesus take the wheel 
Take it from my hands 
Cause I can't do this on my own 
I'm letting go 
So give me one more chance 
Save me from this road I'm on 
Jesus take the wheel.
It was still getting colder  
When she made it to the shoulder 
And the car came to a stop 
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat  
Sleeping like a rock 
And for the first time in a long time 
She bowed her head to pray 
She said, I'm sorry for the way 
I've been living my life 
I know I've got to change 
So from now on tonight:
Jesus take the wheel 
Take it from my hands 
Cause I can't do this on my own 
I'm letting go 
So give me one more chance 
Save me from this road I'm on".
Ooh, Jesus take the wheel 
Ooh, I'm letting go 
So give me one more chance 
Save me from this road I'm on 
From this road I'm on 
Jesus take the wheel 
Ooh, take it, take it from me 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.

Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring  
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun 
Now the jingle hop has begun.
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock 
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time 
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square 
In the frosty air.
What a bright time, it's the right time 
To rock the night away 
Jingle bell time is a swell time 
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh 
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet 
Jingle around the clock 
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet 
That's the jingle bell 
That's the jingle bell 
That's the jingle bell rock.

On a one-horse open sleigh 
Over the fields we go 
Laughing all the way. 
Bells on bob-tail ring 
Making spirits bright 
What fun it is to ride and sing 
A sleighing song tonight.
Jingle bells, jingle bells 
Jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh. 
Jingle bells, jingle bells 
Jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh.
A day or two ago 
I thought I'd take a ride 
And soon Miss Fanny Bright 
Was seated by my side 
The horse was lean and lank 
Misfortune seemed his lot 
He got into a drifted bank 
And we, we got upset.
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells 
Jingle all the way! 
What fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh. 
Jingle bells, jingle bells 
Jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh.
A day or two ago 
The story I must tell 
I went out on the snow 
And on my back I fell 
A gent was riding by 
In a one-horse open sleigh 
He laughed as there 
I sprawling lay 
But quickly drove away.
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells 
Jingle all the way! 
What fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh. 
Jingle bells, jingle bells 
Jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh.
Now the ground is white 
Go it while you're young 
Take the girls tonight 
And sing this sleighing song 
Just get a bob-tailed bay 
Two-forty as his speed 
Hitch him to an open sleigh 
And crack! you'll take the lead.
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells 
Jingle all the way! 
What fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh. 
Jingle bells, jingle bells 
Jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh.

I have a nasty plan  
For Christmas in Iraq. 
I got through checkpoint A 
But not through checkpoint B  
That's when I got shot in the ass  
By the US Military. 
Oh, jingle bombs, jingle bombs  
Mine blew up you see  
Where are all the virgins  
That Bin Laden promised me? 
Oh, jingle bombs, jingle bombs  
U.S. soldiers shot me dead  
The only thing that I have left  
Is this towel up on my head. 
I used to be a man  
But every time I cough  
Thanks to Uncle Sam  
My nuts keep falling off. 
My bombing days are done 
I need to find some work 
Perhaps it would be much safer  
As a convenience store night clerk. 
Oh, jingle bombs, jingle bombs  
I think I got screwed  
Don't laugh at me because I'm dead  
Or I kill you! 

Lean your ear this way!  
Don't you tell a single soul  
What I'm going to say  
Christmas Eve is coming soon  
Now, you dear old man  
Whisper what you'll bring to me  
Tell me if you can. 
When the clock is striking twelve  
When I'm fast asleep 
Down the chimney broad and black  
With your pack you'll creep 
All the stockings you will find  
Hanging in a row 
Mine will be the shortest one  
You'll be sure to know. 
Johnny wants a pair of skates 
Susy wants a dolly 
Nellie wants a story book  
She thinks dolls are folly  
As for me, my little brain  
Isn't very bright 
Choose for me, old Santa Claus 
What you think is right.


Help me cradle the child divine  
God reward thee and all that's thine  
In paradise."  
So prays the mother Mary.
He came among us at Christmastide  
At Christmastide, in Bethlehem  
Men shall bring Him from far and wide  
Love's diadem: Jesus, Jesus  
Lo, He comes, and loves, and saves, and frees us!
"Gladly, dear one, lady mine  
Help I cradle this child of thine  
God's own light on us both shall shine  
In paradise."  
As prays the mother Mary.

At Christmastide, in Bethlehem

Comes to turn us away from ill  
And lies so still  
Within the crib of Mary.

Prophesied once by Ezekiel  
Promised Mary by Gabriel  
Ah, who can tell  
Thy praises, Son of Mary.
He came among us at Christmastide  
At Christmastide, in Bethlehem  
Men shall bring Him from far and wide  
Love's diadem: Jesus, Jesus  
Lo, He comes, and loves, and saves, and frees us!
Thou my lazy heart hast stirred  
Thou, the Father's eternal Word  
Greater than aught that ear has heard  
Thou tiny bird of love  
Thou Son of Mary.
He came among us at Christmastide  
At Christmastide, in Bethlehem  
Men shall bring Him from far and wide  
Love's diadem: Jesus, Jesus  
Lo, He comes, and loves, and saves, and frees us!
Sweet and lovely little one  
Thou princely, beautiful, God's own Son  
Without thee all of us were undone  
Our love is won  
By thing, O Son of Mary.
He came among us at Christmastide  
At Christmastide, in Bethlehem  
Men shall bring Him from far and wide  
Love's diadem: Jesus, Jesus  
Lo, He comes, and loves, and saves, and frees us!
Little man, and God indeed  
Little and poor, thou art all we need  
We will follow where thou dost lead  
And we will heed  
Our brother, born of Mary.
He came among us at Christmastide  
At Christmastide, in Bethlehem  
Men shall bring Him from far and wide  
Love's diadem: Jesus, Jesus  
Lo, He comes, and loves, and saves, and frees us!

You have a long road before You 
Rest Your little head.
Can You feel the weight of Your glory? 
Do You understand the price? 
Does the Father guard Your heart for now 
So You can sleep tonight?
Go to sleep, my Son 
Go and chase Your dreams 
This world can wait for one more moment 
Go and sleep in peace.
I believe the glory of Heaven 
Is lying in my arms tonight 
Lord, I ask that He for just this moment 
Simply be my child.
Go to sleep my Son 
Baby, close Your eyes 
Soon enough You'll save the day 
But for now, dear Child of mine 
Oh my Jesus, Sleep tight.

The Son of God, the angel said 
How could it be? 
Lord, I know He's not my own 
Not of my flesh, not of my bone 
Still Father, let this Baby be 
The son of my love.
Father, show me where I fit into this plan of Yours 
How can a man be father to the Son of God? 
Lord, for all my life I've been a simple carpenter 
How can I raise a King? 
How can I raise a King? 
He looks so small
His face and hands so fair 
And when He cries, the sun just seems to disappear 
But when He laughs, it shines again 
How could it be?
Father, show me where I fit into this plan of Yours 
How can a man be father to the Son of God? 
Lord, for all my life I've been a simple carpenter 
How can I raise a King? 
How can I raise a King? 
How could it be this baby in my arms 
Sleeping now, so peacefully 
The Son of God, the angel said 
How could it be? 
How could it be?

The angels 
Begin their flight;  
Dark skies 
With miles to go 
No footsteps 
To be lost in snow.
They fly to you 
Oh, newborn King 
They fly to you 
Oh, angels sing. 
One is sorrow 
One is peace 
One will come 
To give you sleep 
One is comfort 
One is grief 
One will take 
The tears you weep.
New star 
In a midnight sky 
In heaven 
All the angels fly 
Soft wings so true 
And all things 
They will give to you.
Somewhere 
In a winter night 
The angels 
Begin their flight.
Tonight 
All sing 
Oh, angels 
A newborn King 
Tonight 
All sing 
Oh, angels 
A newborn King.

Let earth receive her King 
Let every heart prepare Him room 
And Heaven and nature sing 
And Heaven and nature sing 
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing.
Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns! 
Let men their songs employ 
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains 
Repeat the sounding joy 
Repeat the sounding joy 
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy.
No more let sins and sorrows grow 
Nor thorns infest the ground 
He comes to make His blessings flow 
Far as the curse is found 
Far as the curse is found 
Far as, far as the curse is found.
He rules the world with truth and grace 
And makes the nations prove 
The glories of His righteousness 
And wonders of His love 
And wonders of His love 
And wonders, wonders, of His love.

God of glory, Lord of love; 
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee,  
Opening to the sun above. 
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness;  
Drive the dark of doubt away; 
Giver of immortal gladness,  
Fill us with the light of day!
All Thy works with joy surround Thee,  
Earth and heaven reflect Thy rays, 
Stars and angels sing around Thee,  
Center of unbroken praise. 
Field and forest, vale and mountain,  
Flowery meadow, flashing sea, 
Singing bird and flowing fountain  
Call us to rejoice in Thee.
Thou art giving and forgiving,  
Ever blessing, ever blessed, 
Wellspring of the joy of living,  
Ocean depth of happy rest! 
Thou our Father, Christ our Brother,  
All who live in love are Thine; 
Teach us how to love each other,  
Lift us to the joy divine.
Mortals, join the happy chorus,  
Which the morning stars began; 
Father love is reigning o'er us,  
Brother love binds man to man. 
Ever singing, march we onward,  
Victors in the midst of strife, 
Joyful music leads us sun ward  
In the triumph song of life.


And you said it was like Christmas 
But you were wrong 
It wasn't like Christmas at all. 
By the time we got to Oslo 
Snow was gone 
And we got lost 
The beds were small 
But we felt so young 
It was just like Christmas 
It was just like Christmas 
It was just like Christmas 
It was just like Christmas 
It was just like Christmas 
It was just like Christmas. 
It was just like Christmas 
It was just like Christmas 
It was just like Christmas 
It was just like Christmas 
It was just like Christmas 
It was just like Christmas 
It was just like Christmas.

Now your asking me 
What I'd like from Santa 
For Christmas this year?  
There's a lot of things, girl  
You could buy for me 
But they wouldn't mean as much  
As you standing by that tree.
Just put a ribbon in your hair, darlin' 
You'll be the best gift anywhere 
Christmas mornin' 
There's no worldly treasure 
I'd like any better 
Than you standin' there 
Just put a ribbon in your hair.
Colored boxes filled with fancy presents 
They were mighty pretty sights 
It's true 
But all those pretty things 
They just can't compare 
To the beauty in you 
Girl, on Christmas day 
The greatest gift I know 
Will be having you to hold  
Underneath the mistletoe. 
Just put a ribbon in your hair, darlin' 
You'll be the best gift anywhere 
Christmas mornin' 
There's no worldly treasure 
I'd like any better 
Than you standin' there 
Just put a ribbon in your hair 
Just put a ribbon in your hair.
Ooohhh baby! 

Kiss me at midnight.
Kiss me at midnight 
(5) 
hey yeah... 
(4) 
oh... 
(3, 2, 1!)  
Kiss me at midnight  
Dance until the morning light 
Party into the New Year 
All of my friends are here 
And when the timing's right 
Kiss me at midnight.
Kiss!
I've been waiting for the special night 
To be with you 
The colors of Christmas are still shining bright 
And I know what we're gonna do 
Anticipating, music is playing 
The magic is in the air 
All through the season 
You've been the reason 
I have so much love to share.
Kiss me at midnight  
Dance until the morning light 
Party into the New Year 
All of my friends are here 
And when the timing's right 
Kiss me at midnight.
Kiss 
Kiss me at midnight 
Kiss.
We've been making promises in the dark 
Our resolutions 
As a brand new year is about to start 
And we're together 
Celebrating, no more waiting 
Our time has arrived. 
The beat in my heart 
As the countdown starts 
Just look into my eyes.
Kiss me at midnight  
Dance until the morning light 
Party into the New Year 
All of my friends are here 
And when the timing's right 
Kiss me at midnight.
Baby, it's New Year's Eve  
Time we can believe 
In making wishes 
Dreams come true 
Just for me and you!
Kiss me at midnight  
Dance until the morning light 
Party into the New Year 
All of my friends are here 
And when the timing's right 
Kiss me at midnight.
Kiss me at midnight  
Dance until the morning light 
Party into the New Year 
All of my friends are here 
And when the timing's right 
Kiss me at midnight.
Kiss me at midnight  
Dance until the morning light...

You will hear my sleigh bells ring  
I am old Kris Kringle  
I'm the King of jingling.
Jingle, jingle reindeer 
Through the frosty air they'll go  
They are not just plain deer  
They're the fastest deer I know.  
(Ho! Ho!)
You must believe that on Christmas Eve  
I won't pass you by  
I'll dash away in my magic sleigh  
Flying through the sky.

This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special. 
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
(Gave it away) 
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special 
(Special) 
Once bitten and twice shy  
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye  
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?  
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me.
(Happy Christmas!)  
I wrapped it up and sent it  
With a note saying "I Love You" 
I meant it  
Now I know what a fool I've been  
But if you kissed me now 
I know you'd fool me again.

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart

(Ooooh oooh baby) 
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes  
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice  
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on  
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on  
A face on a lover, with a fire in his heart  
A man undercover, but you tore me apart  
(Oooh oooh) 
Now I've found a real love 
You'll never fool me again.

But I'll tell you a Christmas tale  
That never has been told;  
Well, you may think you've heard it all  
But you ain't heard yet  
About that crazy Christmas  
That the North pole can't forget.
Rudolph was under the weather 
He had to call in sick  
So he got on the horn to his cousin Leroy 
Who lived out in the sticks;  
He said, "Santa's really counting on me  
And I hate to pass the buck."  
Leroy said "Hey I'm on my way,"  
And he jumped in his pick-up truck.
When Leroy got to the North Pole  
All the reindeer snickered and laughed  
They'd never seen a deer in overalls 
And a John Deere Tractor hat;  
But Santa stepped in and said:  
"Just calm down  
'Cause we've all got a job to do  
"And like it or not, Leroy's in charge 
And he's gonna be leading you."
And it was Leroy, the red neck reindeer  
Hooked to the front of the sleigh  
Delivering toys to all the good ole boys  
And girls along the way  
He's just a down home party animal 
Two-stepping across the sky  
He mixed jingle bells with a rebel yell  
And made history that night.
Before that night was over 
Leroy had changed their tune  
He had them scootin' a hoof 
On every single roof  
By the light of a neon moon;  
Santa wrapped his bag with a Dixie flag  
He was having the time of his life  
And you can hear him call  
"Merry Christmas y'all  
And to all of y'all, a good night."
And it was Leroy, the red neck reindeer  
Hooked to the front of the sleigh  
Delivering toys to all the good ole boys  
And girls along the way  
He's just a down home party animal 
Two-stepping across the sky  
He mixed jingle bells with a rebel yell  
And made history that night.
He mixed jingle bells with a rebel yell 
And made history that night.

Christmas everywhere  
Feel the love of the season wherever you are  
On the small country roads lined with green mistletoe  
Big city streets where a thousand lights glow.
Let it be Christmas everywhere  
Let heavenly music fill the air  
Let every heart sing, let every bell ring  
The story of hope and joy and peace  
And let it be Christmas everywhere  
Let heavenly music fill the air  
Let anger and fear and hate disappear  
Let there be love that lasts through the year  
And let it be Christmas  
Christmas everywhere. 
Let it be Christmas everywhere   
With the gold and the silver, the green and the red   
Christmas everywhere   
In the smiles of all children asleep in their beds   
In the eyes of young babies their first fallen snow   
Elderly memories that never grow old.
Let it be Christmas everywhere  
Let heavenly music fill the air  
Let every heart sing, let every bell ring  
The story of hope and joy and peace  
And let it be Christmas everywhere  
Let heavenly music fill the air  
Let anger and fear and hate disappear  
Let there be love that lasts through the year  
And let it be Christmas  
Christmas everywhere. 
Let it be Christmas everywhere   
In the songs that we sing and the gifts that we bring   
Christmas everywhere   
In what this day means and what we believe   
From the sandy white beaches where blue water rolls   
Snow covered mountains and valleys below. 
Let it be Christmas everywhere  
Let heavenly music fill the air  
Let every heart sing, let every bell ring  
The story of hope and joy and peace  
And let it be Christmas everywhere  
Let heavenly music fill the air  
Let anger and fear and hate disappear  
Let there be love that lasts through the year  
And let it be Christmas  
Christmas everywhere  
Christmas everywhere   
Christmas everywhere.

But the fire is so delightful 
And since we've no place to go 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
It doesn't show signs of stopping 
And I brought some corn for popping 
The lights are turned way down low 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
When we finally say good night 
How I'll hate going out in the storm 
But if you really hold me tight 
All the way home, I'll be warm.
The fire is slowly dying 
And, my dear, we're still good-bying 
But as long as you love me so 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

And let it begin with me  
Let there be peace on earth   
The peace that was meant to be 
With God as our Father   
Brothers all are we  
Let me walk with my brother  
In perfect harmony. 
Let peace begin with me  
Let this be the moment now 
With every step I take   
Let this be my solemn vow 
To take each moment  
And live each moment in peace  
Eternally 
Let there be peace on earth   
And let it begin with me! 

Little altar boy, for I have gone astray  
What must I do to be holy like you?  
Little altar boy ,oh, let me hear you pray.
Little altar boy, I wonder could you ask our Lord  
Ask him, altar boy, to take my sins away  
What must I do to be holy like you?  
Little altar boy, please, let me hear you pray.
Lift up your voice and say a prayer above  
Help me rejoice and fill that prayer with love  
Now I know my life has been all wrong  
Lift up your voice and help a sinner be strong.
Little altar boy, I wonder could you pray for me?  
Could you tell our Lord, I'm gonna change my way today?  
What must I do to be holy like you?  
Little altar boy, oh, let me hear you pray  
Little altar boy please let me hear you pray.

And wonder if you  
Are watching snowflakes too;  
I take a walk downtown  
To where you used to meet me  
There's joy everywhere  
But all that waiting there is:
Just a little Christmas tree  
Lookin' sorta sad and lonely  
Just like me  
No one seems to care  
They just went away   
And left it standing there  
All alone on Christmas eve.
I hear the Christmas bells  
(Bum Bum Bum)  
The happy people singing  
The songs of good cheer   
That only brings me tears  
I sadly close my eyes  
And say a little prayer  
You'll be waiting there for me  
I look but all I see is:
Just a little Christmas tree  
Lookin' sorta sad and lonely  
Just like me  
No one seems to care  
They just went away   
And left it standing there  
All alone on Christmas eve.
This is the season of love  
(This is the season of love)  
But I'm as sad as I can be  
(Sad as can be)  
Why did you have to leave me?  
(Why did you leave me?)  
(Why did you leave me?)
Just a little Christmas tree  
Lookin' sorta sad and lonely  
Just like me  
No one seems to care  
They just went away   
And left it standing there  
All alone on Christmas eve.

On the dusty road  
Got to keep on plodding onwards  
With your precious load.
Been a long time, little donkey  
Through the winter's night  
Don't give up now, little donkey  
Bethlehem's in sight.
Chorus 
Ring out those bells tonight  
Bethlehem, Bethlehem  
Follow that star tonight  
Bethlehem, Bethlehem.
Little donkey, little donkey  
Had a heavy day  
Little donkey  
Carry Mary safely on her way.
Little donkey, little donkey  
On the dusty road  
There are wise men waiting for a  
Sign to bring them here.
Do not falter, little donkey  
There's a star ahead  
It will guide you, little donkey  
To a cattle shed.
Chorus 
Ring out those bells tonight  
Bethlehem, Bethlehem  
Follow that star tonight  
Bethlehem, Bethlehem.

Pa rum pum pum pum

We will lend a coat of fur  
We will rock you, rock you, rock you  
We will rock you, rock you, rock you  
See the fur to keep you warm  
Snugly round your tiny form.
Mary's little baby, sleep, sweetly sleep  
Sleep in comfort, slumber deep  
We will rock you, rock you, rock you  
We will rock you, rock you, rock you  
We will serve you all we can  
Darling, darling little man.

I heard a sheep bell softly calling them 
Along the little road to Bethlehem.
Beside an open door as I drew nigh 
I heard sweet Mary sing a lullaby 
She sang about the lambs at close of day 
And rocked her tiny King among the hay.
Across the air the silver sheep bells rang 
"The lambs are coming home" sweet Mary sang 
"Your star of gold, your star of gold is shining in the sky 
So sleep, my little King, go lullaby".
As I walked down the road at set of sun 
The lambs were coming homeward one by one 
I heard a sheep bell softly calling them 
Along the little road to Bethlehem.

Christmas comes this time each year.
Well, way up North where the air gets cold  
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told;  
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red  
And he spends the whole year workin' out on his sled.
It's the little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
It's the little Saint Nick   
Little Saint Nick.
Just a little bobsled, we call it ol' Saint Nick  
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick  
She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel  
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel.
It's the little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
It's the little Saint Nick   
Little Saint Nick.
Run, run reindeer  
Run run reindeer 
Run run reindeer  
Run run reindeer   
We don't miss no one.
He's hauling through the snow at a frightenin' speed  
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead,  
He's gotta wear his goggles 'cause the snow really flies  
And he's cruisin' every pad with a little surprise.
It's the little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
It's the little Saint Nick   
Little Saint Nick.
Merry Christmas, Santa  
Christmas comes this time each year.
Merry Christmas, Santa  
Christmas comes this time each year.

Once for favored sinners slain; 
Thousand thousand saints attending,    
Swell the triumph of His train:   
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!   
God appears on earth to reign.
Every eye shall now behold Him    
Robed in dreadful majesty;  
Those who set at naught and sold Him, 
Pierced and nailed Him to the tree,    
Deeply wailing, deeply wailing, deeply wailing,   
Shall the true Messiah see.
Every island, sea, and mountain,  
Heaven and earth, shall flee away;  
All who hate Him must, confounded, 
Hear the trump proclaim the day:  
Come to judgment! Come to judgment! Come to judgment!   
Come to judgment! Come away!   
Now redemption, long expected,  
See in solemn pomp appear;   
All His saints, by man rejected,   
Now shall meet Him in the air:   
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!    
See the day of God appear!  
Answer Thine own bride and Spirit, 
Hasten, Lord, the general doom!   
The new Heaven and earth to inherit,  
Take Thy pining exiles home:     
All creation, all creation, all creation,    
Travails! groans! and bids Thee come! 
The dear tokens of His passion  
Still His dazzling body bears; 
Cause of endless exultation  
To His ransomed worshipers; 
With what rapture, with what rapture, with what rapture  
Gaze we on those glorious scars!
Yea, Amen! let all adore Thee,  
High on Thine eternal throne; 
Savior, take the power and glory,      
Claim the kingdom for Thine own; 
O come quickly! O come quickly! O come quickly!    
Everlasting God, come down!

From tender stem hath sprung  
Of Jesse's lineage coming  
As men of old have sung  
It came, a floweret bright  
Amid the cold of winter  
When half spent was the night.
Isaiah 'twas foretold it  
The Rose I have in mind  
With Mary we behold it  
The virgin mother kind  
To show God's love aright  
She bore to us a Savior  
When half spent was the night.
O Flower, whose fragrance tender  
With sweetness fills the air  
Dispel with glorious splendor  
The darkness everywhere  
True man, yet very God  
From sin and death now save us  
And share our every load.
German: Es ist ein Ros entsprungen
Es ist ein Ros' entsprungen 
Aus einer Wurzel zart 
Wie uns die Alten sungen 
Aus Jesse kam die Art 
Und hat ein Blümlein bracht 
Mitten im kalten Winter 
Wohl zu der halben Nacht.
Das Röslein das ich meine 
Davon Jesaias sagt 
Maria ist's, die Reine 
Die uns das Blümlein bracht 
Aus Gottes ewigem Rat 
Hat sie ein Kindlein g'boren 
Bleibend ein reine Magd.

That's where I'll be 
Since you left me. 
My tears would melt the snow 
What can I do 
Without you 
I've got no place, no place to go.
It'll be lonely this Christmas 
Without you to hold 
It'll be lonely this Christmas 
Lonely and cold 
It'll be cold, so cold 
Without you to hold 
This Christmas.
Each time I remember 
The day you went away 
And how I would listen 
To things you have to say 
I just break down 
As I look around 
And the only things I see 
Are emptiness and loneliness 
And an unlit Christmas tree.
It'll be lonely this Christmas 
Without you to hold 
It'll be lonely this Christmas 
Lonely and cold 
It'll be cold, so cold 
Without you to hold 
This Christmas.
You remember last year? 
When you and I were together 
We never thought there'd be an end. 
And I remember looking at you then 
And I remember thinking  
That Christmas must have been made for us 
Cause darlin'  
This is the time that you really need love 
When it means so very very much.
It'll be lonely this Christmas 
Without you to hold 
It'll be lonely this Christmas 
Lonely and cold 
It'll be cold, so cold 
Without you to hold 
This Christmas.
Merry Christmas darlin'  
Wherever you are.

Love all lovely, love divine;  
Love was born at Christmas  
Star and angels gave the sign.
Worship we the Godhead  
Love incarnate, love divine;  
Worship we our Jesus  
But wherewith for sacred sign?
Love shall be our token  
Love shall be yours and love be mine  
Love to God and to all men  
Love for plea and gift and sign.

It's the happiest time of the year 
Filled with laughter and good cheer 
As you watch the snow, sweet love  
You'll hear me say:
"You've got my heart on Christmas 
Inside my soul your love remains 
Love's in our hearts 
On Christmas day". 
The days and weeks and months go by so slowly 
We are both wishing them to fly  
As the night begins to fall 
Twilight crowns the bedroom cheer  
Such a rush of joy 
Your love, it comforts me 
And I do believe:
Love's in our hearts on Christmas  
Though far apart  
As one we pray  
Love's in our hearts  
On Christmas day. 
Snowflakes melt in your eye and turns to tears  
But your cheek, it stays dry  
With your warm smile so near  
I have no fear  
We're gonna make it. 
Love's in our hearts on Christmas  
Though far apart  
As one we pray  
Loves in our hearts  
On Christmas day.

While men seek fame and great renown  
In lowliness our King comes down. 
Jesus, Jesus, precious one 
How we thank You that You've come  
Jesus, Jesus, precious one 
A manger throne for God's own son. 
You left the sound of angels' praise   
To come for men with unkind ways 
And by this Baby's helplessness  
The power of nations is laid to rest. 
Jesus, Jesus, precious one  
How we thank You that You've come 
Jesus, Jesus, precious one  
A manger throne for God's own son. 
What kind of King would come so small 
From glory to a humble stall?  
That dirty manger is my heart too   
I'll make it a royal throne for You. 
Jesus, Jesus, precious one  
How we thank You that You've come  
Jesus, Jesus, precious one  
A manger throne for God's own son. 
Jesus, Jesus, precious one 
Precious Jesus  
How we thank You that You've come 
Jesus, Jesus, precious one  
A manger throne  
My heart is a throne 
My heart is a throne for God's own son.

Three great kings I met at early morn 
Were on their way to meet the newly born 
With gifts of gold brought from far away 
And valiant warriors to guard the royal treasure 
With gifts of gold brought from far away 
Their shields all shining in their bright array. 
Ce matin, j'ai rencontre le train 
De trois grands rois qui allaient en voyage 
Ce matin, j'ai rencontre le train 
De trois grands rois dessus le grand chemin 
Tout charges d'or les suivaient d'abord 
De grands guerriers et les gardes du tresor 
Tout charges d'or les suivaient d'abord 
De grands guerriers avec leurs boucliers. 
For Thy mercy and Thy grace 
Constant through another year 
Hear our song of thankfulness 
Father and Redeemer hear 
Dark the future; let Thy light 
Guide us, bright and morning star 
Fierce our foes and hard the fight 
Arm us Savior for the war. 
In our weakness and distress 
Rock of strength be Thou our stay 
In the pathless wilderness 
Be our true and living way 
Keep us faithful; keep us pure 
Keep us evermore Thine own 
Help, O help us to endure 
Fit us for the promised crown.

That your baby boy will one day walk on water? 
Mary, did you know 
That your baby boy will save our sons and daughters? 
Did you know 
That your baby boy has come to make you new? 
This child that you've delivered 
Will soon deliver you?
Mary, did you know 
That your baby boy will give sight to a blind man? 
Mary, did you know 
That your baby boy will calm a storm with His hand? 
Did you know 
That your baby boy has walked where angels trod? 
And when you kiss your little baby 
You've kissed the face of God?
Mary, did you know? 
The blind will see 
The deaf will hear 
And the dead will live again 
The lame will leap 
The dumb will speak 
The praises of the Lamb?
Mary, did you know 
That your baby boy is Lord of all creation? 
Mary, did you know 
That your baby boy will one day rule the nations? 
Did you know 
That your baby boy is heaven's perfect Lamb? 
This sleeping child you're holding 
Is the Great I Am?
Oh Mary did you know?

Mary had a baby (Oh My Lord)

The people keep a-comin' an' the train done gone.

So the Holy Bible say  
Mary's Boy Child, Jesus Christ  
Was born on Christmas Day. 
Hark, now hear the angels sing  
"New King's born today  
And man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas Day."
While shepherds watched their flocks by night 
They saw a bright new shining star  
And heard a choir from heaven sing  
The music came from afar.
Hark, now hear the angels sing  
"New King's born today  
And man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas Day."
Oh, a moment still worth was a glow  
All the bells rang out  
There were tears of joy and laughter  
People shouted, "Let everyone know  
There is hope for all to find peace".
Now Joseph and his wife Mary  
Came to Bethlehem that night 
They found no place to bear her Child  
Not a single room was in sight.
By and by they found a little nook  
In a stable all forlorn  
And in a manger cold and dark  
Mary's little Boy Child was born.
Trumpets sound and angels sing  
Listen to what they say  
That man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas Day.
Oh, a moment still worth was a glow  
All the bells rang out  
There were tears of joy and laughter  
People shouted "let everyone know  
There is hope for all to find peace".
Oh my Lord.

 Masters in this hall  
Hear ye news today  
Brought from over seas  
And ever you I pray.
Chorus: 
Sing we now noel  
Sing we noel clear!  
Holpen all the folk on earth  
Born the Son of God so dear!
Then to Bethl'em town  
Went we two by two  
In a sorry place  
We heard the oxen low.
Chorus: 
Sing we now noel  
Sing we noel clear!  
Holpen all the folk on earth  
Born the Son of God so dear!
Ox and ass Him know  
Kneeling on their knee  
Wonderous joy had   
This little babe to see.
Chorus: 
Sing we now noel  
Sing we noel clear!  
Holpen all the folk on earth  
Born the Son of God so dear!
This is Christ, the Lord  
Masters be ye glad!

Chorus:

Sing we noel clear!  
Holpen all the folk on earth

And kiss my lips anymore  
She's gonna leave me 
And she don't believe me 
That I'll be true now.

Well, maybe she don't love me 
Is not thinkin' of me 
But why'd she do it this time o' year? 
She knows that I'll miss her 
And I'll wanna kiss her 
If just for Christmas.

Merry Christmas, baby 
Merry Christmas, baby 
Merry Christmas, baby.
Tell me, what should I do? 
To really convince you 
That I'm not the guy anymore? 
Take back my ring now 
I'll do anything now 
But please forgive me.
I've made my mistake but 
I'm willing to wake up 
And never mess around anymore 
Oh, why did we break up? 
There's still time to make up 
If just for Christmas.
Merry Christmas, baby 
Merry Christmas, baby 
Merry Christmas, baby.
I've made my mistake but 
I'm willing to wake up 
And never mess around anymore 
Oh, why did we break up? 
There's still time to make up 
If just for Christmas.
Merry Christmas, baby 
Merry Christmas, baby 
Merry Christmas, baby.

The Christmas rush is through 
But I still have one more wish to make 
A special one for you.
Merry Christmas, darling 
We're apart, that's true 
But I can dream and in my dreams 
I'm Christmasing with you.
Holidays are joyful 
There's always something new 
But every day's a holiday 
When I'm near to you.
The lights on my tree 
I wish you could see 
I wish it every day.
The logs on the fire 
Fill me with desire 
To see you and to say:
That I wish you a merry Christmas 
Happy New Year too 
I've just one wish 
On this Christmas Eve 
I wish I were with you.
Logs on the fire  
Fill me with desire  
To see you and to say. 
That I wish you Merry Christmas  
Happy New Year, too  
I've just one wish  
On this Christmas Eve  
I wish I were with you  
I wish I were with you.

It's the season of love and understanding 
Merry Christmas everyone. 
Time for parties and celebration 
People dancing, all night long 
Time for presents and exchanging kisses 
Time for singing Christmas songs. 
We're gonna have a party tonight 
I'm gonna find that girl  
Underneath the mistletoe 
We'll kiss by candlelight. 
Room is swaying, records playing 
All the old songs, we love to hear 
All I wish that everyday was Christmas 
What a nice way to spend the year. 
We're gonna have a party tonight 
I'm gonna find that girl  
Underneath the mistletoe 
We'll kiss by candlelight. 
Snow is falling all around me 
Children playing, having fun 
It's the season of love and understanding 
Merry Christmas everyone 
Merry Christmas, everyone 
Merry Christmas everyone. 
Snow is falling all around me 
Children playing, having fun 
It's the season of love and understanding 
Merry Christmas everyone. 
Snow is falling all around me 
Children playing, having fun 
It's the season of love and understanding 
Merry Christmas everyone.

Merry Christmas everyone. 
Snow is falling all around me 
Children playing, having fun 
It's the season of love and understanding 
Merry Christmas everyone 
Merry Christmas everyone 
Oooh Merry Christmas everyone!

And I addressed it to the man who vowed to love you  
And on the little card I wrote these words inside: 
Merry Christmas to me  
Just one gift beneath my tree  
For the fool who let you leave  
Merry Christmas to me. 
Then I sat down in my chair and thought about you  
About the many reasons why you're gone  
And I opened up the present that I gave to me  
And realized how much it hurts to be alone. 
Merry Christmas to me  
Just one gift beneath my tree  
For the fool who let you leave  
Merry Christmas to me. 
I am the fool who let you leave 
Merry Christmas to me.

Remembering Christmas the way it had been 
So many seasons ago. 
When children would reach for their stockings 
And open the presents they found 
The lights on the tree would shine bright in their eyes 
Reflecting the love all around. 
This year there's no one to open the gifts 
No reason for trimming the tree 
And just as a tear made its way to the floor 
She heard voices outside start to sing. 
Merry Christmas to all who may dwell here 
Merry Christmas if even just one 
May the joy of the season surround you 
Merry Christmas with love. 
Carolers sang as she opened the door 
Faces of friends in the crowd 
And all of the shadows of lonely reminders 
Driven away by the sound. 
Now the heart that for years had been silent 
Was suddenly filled with a song 
As she clung to their hands like a child in the night 
She found her self singing along: 
Merry Christmas to all who may dwell here 
Merry Christmas if even just one 
May the joy of the season surround you 
Merry Christmas. 
Merry Christmas to all who may dwell here 
Merry Christmas if even just one 
May the joy of the season surround you 
Merry Christmas with love. 
Merry Christmas with love. 

Does he ride a red nosed reindeer? 
Does he turn up on his sleigh 
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?
Chorus:  
So here it is, Merry Christmas 
Everybody's having fun 
Look to the future now 
It's only just begun.
Are you waiting for the family to arrive? 
Are you sure you got room to spare inside? 
Does your granny always tell you, that the old songs are the best? 
Then she's up and rock 'n' rollin' with the rest.
Chorus:  
So here it is, Merry Christmas 
Everybody's having fun 
Look to the future now 
It's only just begun.
What will your daddy do? 
When he sees your Mama kissin' Santa Claus? 
Ah ah!
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall? 
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall? 
Do you ride on down the hillside in a buggy you have made? 
When you land upon your head then you've been sleighed.
Chorus:  
So here it is, Merry Christmas 
Everybody's having fun 
Look to the future now 
It's only just begun.
Chorus:  
So here it is, Merry Christmas 
Everybody's having fun 
Look to the future now 
It's only just begun.
Chorus:  
So here it is, Merry Christmas 
Everybody's having fun 
Look to the future now 
It's only just begun.
Chorus:  
So here it is, Merry Christmas 
Everybody's having fun 
Look to the future now 
It's only just begun.

The room's all aglow 
Outside the December wind blows 
Away in the distance  
The carolers sing in the snow 
Everybody's laughing 
The world is celebrating 
And everyone's so happy 
Except for me tonight.
Because I miss you  
Most at Christmas time 
And I can't get you 
Get you off my mind 
Every other season comes along 
And I'm all right 
But then I miss you 
Most at Christmas time.
I gaze out the window 
This cold winter's night 
At all of the twinkling lights 
Alone in the darkness 
Remembering when you were mine 
Everybody's smiling 
The whole world is rejoicing 
And everyone's embracing 
Except for you and I.
Baby, I miss you most 
At Christmas time 
And I can't get you 
Get you off my mind 
Every other season comes along 
And I'm all right 
But then I miss you most
At Christmas time
In the springtime 
Those memories start to fade 
With the April rain 
Through the summer days 
Till autumn's leaves are gone 
I get by without you 
Till the snow begins to fall.
And then I miss you 
Most at Christmas time 
And I can't get you 
Get you off my mind 
Every other season comes along 
And I'm all right 
But then I miss you most 
At Christmas time.

Wrap me in a great big bow 
And tear me apart.
It's Christmas time 
So open up the flood gates 
Tell me that you'll be late 
And rip me apart.
Cause you say that 
You say that things will be alright 
But I've heard that  
I've heard that so many times. 
And I know that 
It's not Christmas  
If the snow don't fall 
And I'm still standing here  
Three feet small 
Lose our troubles  
Because after all 
It's Christmas time.
It's Christmas time.
Cold 
Ice on the walkways 
Slip in to the games we play 
We're falling apart.
A great big house 
That's made out of ginger bread 
Crumbles to the ground 
We're breaking apart.

But you said that  
You said that things would be alright 
But I've heard that  
I've heard that so many times.  

And I know that 
It's not Christmas  
If the snow don't fall 
And I'm still standing here  
Three feet small 
Lose our troubles  
Because after all 
It's Christmas time.
And I've been waiting   
For you to come  
And it's hard   
Cause I feel so alone  
And I just want   
You to come home.
Waiting for you to come  
And it's hard   
Cause I feel so alone  
And I just want you   
To come home.

It's not Christmas  
If the snow don't fall 
And I'm still standing here  
Three feet small 
Lose our troubles  
Because after all 
It's Christmas time.

It's not Christmas 
If the snow don't fall 
You're not here 
To keep me safe and warm 
Lose our troubles 
Because after all  
It's Christmas time.
It's Christmas time again 
And all your friends  
All your friends 
Are smiling 
It's Christmas time.

Tasty pheasants, Christmas presents  
Countrysides covered with snow.
Oh, by gosh, by jingle  
It's time for carols and Kris Kringle  
Overeating, merry greetings  
From relatives you don't know.
Then comes that big night  
Giving the tree the trim  
You'll hear voices by starlight  
Singing a Yuletide hymn.
Oh, by gosh, by golly  
It's time for mistletoe and holly  
Fancy ties an' granny's pies  
An' folks stealin' a kiss or two  
As they whisper, "Merry Christmas" to you.

Dreams of Santa, dreams of snow 
Fingers numb, faces aglow.
Christmas time, mistletoe and wine 
Children singing Christian rhyme 
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree 
A time to rejoice in the good that we see. 
A time for living, a time for believing 
A time for trusting, not deceiving 
Love and laughter and joy ever after 
Ours for the taking, just follow the Master.
Christmas time, mistletoe and wine 
Children singing Christian rhyme 
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree 
A time to rejoice in the good that we see. 
Silent night  
Holy night.
It's a time for giving, a time for getting 
A time for forgiving and for forgetting 
Christmas is love, Christmas is peace 
A time for hating and fighting to cease.
Christmas time 
Silent night 
Mistletoe and wine 
Holy night 
Children singing Christian rhyme 
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree 
A time to rejoice in the good that we see.
Christmas time, mistletoe and wine 
Children singing Christian rhyme 
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree 
A time to rejoice in the good that we see. 
Christmas time, mistletoe and wine 
Children singing Christian rhyme 
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree 
A time to rejoice in the good that we see. 
Christmas time 
Silent night 
Mistletoe and wine 
Holy night 
Children singing Christian rhyme 
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree 
A time to rejoice in the good that we see.

When all through the castle  
My monsters were having a Yuletide hassle  
The tree was all trimmed in ghoulish things  
Like werewolf fangs and vampire wings.
(It was a monster's holiday) 
But they were up to no good  
(It was a monster's holiday) 
Didn't act like good monsters should  
(It was a monster's holiday) 
They found themselves a new play  
(It was a monster's holiday) 
They planned to rob Santa's sleigh.
They were making a list   
And checking it twice  
Frankenstein wanted a shiny new trike  
A new chain for Yarnush  
A brace for Igor's back  
A speed shaver for Wolfman  
A new cape for Drac.
(It was a monster's holiday) 
They were up to no good  
(It was a monster's holiday) 
Didn't act like good monster's should  
(It was a monster's holiday) 
They found themselves a new play  
(It was a monster's holiday) 
They planned to rob Santa's sleigh.
The Mummy was to signal from the castle roof  
At the very first sound of a reindeer hoof  
As Santa slid down the chimney wall  
The zombies were to make off with sleigh and all.
From beyond the moat there arose such a clatter  
I jumped to the window to see what was the matter  
Like a bolt of lightning it happened so quick  
And there in our midst stood old Saint Nick.
He began to dig down deep in his sack  
And came up with the traction for Igor's back  
Drac got his cape  
Franky's trike made him behave  
Even Wolfman was happy, now he can shave.
(It was a monster's holiday) 
And all ended well  
(It was a monster's holiday) 
And Santa was really swell  
(It was a monster's holiday) 
No need to rob Santa's sleigh  
(It was a monster's holiday) 
Maybe next year he'll come back.
So the children everywhere were spared the grief  
Of losing their presents to a monster sleigh thief  
Now the monsters love Santa and say they'll behave  
And never again rob sleighs or graves.
(It was a monster's holiday) 
Igor, what do you think of Santa now?  
(It was a monster's holiday) 
"Arrrrrr...Santa good!"  
(It was a monster's holiday) 
And Santa said as he drove out of sight  
(It was a monster's holiday)
(Dracula accent):  
"Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho  
Merry Christmas to all  
And to all a good night - blaaaa!"  
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh  
Dashing through the snow  
Where is that reindeer with the red nose, blaaaa  
On Donner, on Blitzen, on Dancer..

Couples holding hands, places to go  
Seems like everyone but me is in love. 
Santa, can you hear me?  
I signed my letter, that I sealed with a kiss  
I sent it off  
It just said this,  
"I know exactly what I want this year  
Santa, can you hear me?  
I want my baby (baby, yeah)  
I want someone to love me   Someone to hold me"  
Maybe (maybe, maybe maybe) 
He'll be all my own 
In a big red bow.

No room, here in His world turned away  
No room, no room.
No room, here in the hearts of mankind  
No room, no cheery welcome could find  
No room, surely the world is blind  
No room, no room. 
Angels, in heaven up yonder  
Watch with amazement and wonder  
To see the Son of the Highest treated so  
No room.
No room, only a manger of hay  
No room, He is a stranger today  
No room, here in His world turned away  
No room, no room, no room.

Somewhere in the dark  
His words cut the silent night  
"Take my hand, for the Child  
That you carry is God's own  
And though it seems the road is long  
We're not that far from Bethlehem  
Where all our hope and joy begins  
For in our arms we'll cherish Him  
We're not that far from Bethlehem".
Let us celebrate  
As the Christmases go by  
Learn to live our days  
With our hearts near to the Child  
Ever drawn, ever close  
To the only love that lasts   
And though 2000 years have passed.
We're not that far from Bethlehem  
Where all our hope and joy began  
For when our hearts still cherish Him  
We're not that far                      
We're not that far from Bethlehem  
Where all our hope and joy began  
For when our hearts still cherish Him  
We're not that far   
We're not that far from Bethlehem.

Somebody snitched on me  
I hid a frog in sister's bed  
Somebody snitched on me.  
I spilled some ink on Mommy's rug  
I made Tommy eat a bug  
Bought some gum with a penny slug  
Somebody snitched on me. 
Oh, I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas  
Mommy and Daddy are mad  
I'm getting nuttin' for Christmas  
'Cause I ain't been nuttin' but bad. 
I put a tack on teacher's chair  
Somebody snitched on me  
I tied a knot in Susie's hair  
Somebody snitched on me  
I did a dance on Mommy's plants  
Climbed a tree and tore my pants  
Filled the sugar bowl with ants  
Somebody snitched on me. 
So, I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas  
Mommy and Daddy are mad  
I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas  
'Cause I ain't been nuttin' but bad. 
I won't be seeing Santa Claus  
Somebody snitched on me  
He won't come visit me because  
Somebody snitched on me  
Next year I'll be going straight  
Next year I'll be good, just wait  
I'd start now, but it's too late 
Somebody snitched on me. 
So you better be good whatever you do  
'Cause if you're bad, I'm warning you  
You'll get nuttin' for Christmas.

Thy leaves are so unchanging 
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree! 
Thy leaves are so unchanging 
Not only green when summer's here 
But also when 'tis cold and drear 
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree! 
Thy leaves are so unchanging.
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree! 
Much pleasure thou can'st give me

Afforded me the greatest glee 
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree! 
Much pleasure thou can'st give me.
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree! 
Thy candles shine so brightly 
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree! 
Thy candles shine so brightly 
From base to summit, gay and bright 
There's only splendor for the sight. 
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree! 
Thy candles shine so brightly.
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree! 
How richly God has decked thee 
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree! 
How richly God has decked thee

And trust in God unchangingly 
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree! 
How richly God has decked thee!.

And ransom captive Israel  
That mourns in lonely exile here  
Until the Son of God appear  
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee, O Israel.
O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free  
Thine own from Satan's tyranny  
From depths of Hell Thy people save  
And give them victory o'er the grave  
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee, O Israel.
O come, Thou Day-Spring, come and cheer  
Our spirits by Thine advent here  
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night  
And death's dark shadows put to flight.  
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee, O Israel.
O come, Thou Key of David, come  
And open wide our heavenly home  
Make safe the way that leads on high  
And close the path to misery  
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee, O Israel.
O come, O come, Thou Lord of might  
Who to Thy tribes, on Sinai's height  
In ancient times did'st give the Law  
In cloud, and majesty and awe  
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee, O Israel. 

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.   
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.   
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.   
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!   
O night divine, the night when Christ was born  
O night, O holy night, O night divine!   
O night, O holy night, O night divine! 
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming  
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.   
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming  
Now come the wise men from out of the Orient land.   
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger  
In all our trials born to be our friends   
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger  
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!   
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Truly He taught us to love one another   
His law is love and His gospel is peace   
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother  
And in his name all oppression shall cease   
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we  
With all our hearts we praise His holy name   
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we  
His power and glory ever more proclaim!  
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
French 
Minuit, chrétiens, c'est l'heure solennelle  
Où l'Homme-Dieu descendit jusqu'à nous  
Pour effacer la tache originelle   
Et de Son Père arrêter le courroux.   
Le monde entier tressaille d'espérance  
En cette nuit qui lui donne un Sauveur. 
Chorus 
Peuple à genoux, attends ta délivrance  
Noël, Noël, voici le Rédempteur,  
Noël, Noël, voici le Rédempteur! 
Le Rédempteur a brisé toute entrave:  
La terre est libre, et le ciel est ouvert.  
Il voit un frère où n'était qu'un esclave,  
L'amour unit ceux qu'enchaînait le fer.  
Qui Lui dira notre reconnaissance,  
C'est pour nous tous qu'Il naît,  
Qu'Il souffre et meurt.
Chorus 
Peuple à genoux, attends ta délivrance  
Noël, Noël, voici le Rédempteur,  
Noël, Noël, voici le Rédempteur! 

How still we see thee lie!   
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep   
The silent stars go by  
Yet in thy dark streets shineth   
The everlasting Light   
The hopes and fears of all the years   
Are met in thee to-night.
For Christ is born of Mary  
And gathered all above  
While mortals sleep, the angels keep   
Their watch of wondering love  
O morning stars, together    
Proclaim the holy birth!   
And praises sing to God, the King  
And peace to men on earth.
How silently, how silently  
The wondrous gift is given!   
So God imparts to human hearts   
The blessings of his heaven  
No ear may hear his coming   
But in this world of sin   
Where meek souls will receive him, still   
The dear Christ enters in. 
Where children pure and happy   
Pray to the blessed Child   
Where misery cries out to thee  
Son of the mother mild  
Where charity stands watching   
And faith holds wide the door   
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks   
And Christmas comes once more. 
O holy Child of Bethlehem!   
Descend to us, we pray  
Cast out our sin and enter in   
Be born in us to-day   
We hear the Christmas angels   
The great glad tidings tell   
O come to us, abide with us   
Our Lord Emmanuel!

He is alpha and omega, He the source, the ending He  
Of the things that are, that have been  
And that future years shall see, evermore and evermore! 
At His Word the worlds were framed; He commanded; it was done  
Heaven and earth and depths of ocean in their threefold order one  
All that grows beneath the shining  
Of the moon and burning sun, evermore and evermore! 
He is found in human fashion, death and sorrow here to know  
That the race of Adam's children doomed by law to endless woe 
May not henceforth die and perish  
In the dreadful gulf below, evermore and evermore!
O that birth forever blessed, when the virgin, full of grace  
By the Holy Ghost conceiving, bare the Savior of our race  
And the Babe, the world's Redeemer  
First revealed His sacred face, evermore and evermore! 
This is He whom seers in old time chanted of with one accord  
Whom the voices of the prophets promised in their faithful word  
Now He shines, the long expected  
Let creation praise its Lord, evermore and evermore! 
O ye heights of heaven adore Him; angel hosts, His praises sing  
Powers, dominions, bow before Him, and extol our God and King!  
Let no tongue on earth be silent  
Every voice in concert sing, evermore and evermore! 
Righteous Judge of souls departed, righteous King of them that live  
On the Father's throne exalted none in might with Thee may strive  
Who at last in vengeance coming  
Sinners from Thy face shalt drive, evermore and evermore! 
Thee let old men, thee let young men, thee let boys in chorus sing  
Matrons, virgins, little maidens, with glad voices answering  
Let their guileless songs re-echo  
And the heart its music bring, evermore and evermore! 
Christ, to Thee with God the Father, and, O Holy Ghost, to Thee  
Hymn and chant with high thanksgiving, and unwearied praises be  
Honor, glory, and dominion  
And eternal victory, evermore and evermore!

Oh come ye, Oh come ye to Bethlehem    
Come and behold Him, born the King of Angels   
Oh come, let us adore Him,  
Oh come, let us adore Him  
Oh come, let us adore Him,  
Christ the Lord.
Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation 
Oh Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above    
Glory to God in the highest 
Oh come, let us adore Him,  
Oh come, let us adore Him  
Oh come, let us adore Him,  
Christ the Lord.
Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning 
Jesus, to Thee be all glory giving    
Word of the Father now in flesh appearing    
Oh come, let us adore Him,  
Oh come, let us adore Him  
Oh come, let us adore Him,  
Christ the Lord.

Larry: Could that be Santa? 
Could that be him? 
Could it be the one  
Who brings presents  
For a cucumber like me? 
A good cucumber like me?
Narrator: Larry is surprised to be greeted
Not by Santa 
But a crafty bank robber!
Larry: Who are you?
Bank robber: I'm a bank robber! 
And I've come to rob your bank 
Oh yes! I've come to rob your bank 
And I've come to take your dimes  
And swipe your nickels 
So stand back, step aside you silly pickle! 
And let me in!
Narrator: Although frightened by the intruder 
In the spirit of Christmas Larry makes an offering.
Larry: I'm not a banker 
I have no bank, my robbing friend 
But I have cookies 
Three yummy cookies 
And I don't have nickels 
But please take this, my robbing friend 
Eat one of these my robbing friend 
They are for Santa 
But you may have one.

By Larry's good will  
But Larry, although momentarily distracted  
Is still excited about seeing Santa.

I came to rob your bank   
Oh yes!

You shared a cookie  
A yummy cookie  
Though I'd love to take your dimes  
Perhaps another time  
Because it's Christmas!"
Knock, knock, knock
Larry: Could that be Santa? 
Could that be him? 
Could it be the one  
Who brings presents  
For a cucumber like me? 
A good cucumber like me?
Narrator: Once again, it is not Santa   
Who has come to Larry's door  
But this time a savage Norseman. 
Larry: Who are you?
Viking: I'm a Viking!  
And I've come to take your land  
Oh yes! I've come to take your land  
And I've come to burn your crops   
And steal your horses!  
And I've come to   
Step on your chickens  
And soil your quilts!
Narrator: Although frightened by the intruder   
In the spirit of Christmas  
Larry makes an offering. 
Larry: I don't have land  
I don't have crops, my Viking friend  
But I have cookies!  
Two yummy cookies!  
And I don't have horses  
But please take this, my Viking friend  
Eat one of these, my Viking friend  
They are for Santa  
But you may have one!
Narrator: The Viking is also touched 
By Larry's good will   
But Larry's thoughts are still with Santa. 
Larry: Oh, Santa! 
I can't wait for you to come 
I just can't wait for you to come 
I've got a cookie!  
A yummy cookie!  
Just for you, for when you come  
Oh me!

Because it's Christmas!
Viking: I'm a Viking!  
I came to take your land 
Oh yes!  
I came to take your land  
You shared a cookie 
A yummy cookie 
Though I'd love to soil your quilts 
I don't think that I will  
Because it's Christmas!
Knock, knock, knock
Larry: Could that be Santa? 
Could that be him? 
Could it be the one  
Who brings presents  
For a cucumber like me? 
A good cucumber like me?
Narrator: Larry is greeted now  
By an agent of the Internal Revenue Service. 
Larry: Who are you?
Peach: I'm from the IRS! 
And I've come to tax your...
SLAM
Larry: Oh, Santa! 
I can't wait for you to come 
I just can't wait for you to come 
It's finally Santa! 
It's finally him! 
At last, the one who brings presents  
For a cucumber like me 
A good cucumber like me!
Santa: I'm Santa! 
And I've come to bring you gifts 
Oh yes!  
I've come to bring you gifts 
And I've come to stuff your stockings 
Oh, ho ho ho! 
And I've come to jiggle my belly 
And wiggle my nose 
Hey, wait a minute! 
Isn't that my belt? 
And what are you doing with my hat? 
So you're the ones!
Bank robber: Wait a minute, I can explain!
Viking: We've changed!
Santa: Nobody messes with Santa! 
You know that, don't you? 
You've been very naughty! 
And I've got a list!
Peach: Did you claim that?
Larry: Merry Christmas!


Little toy drums coming from a sack  
Carried by a man dressed in white and red  
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed?
Close your eyes  
Listen to the skies  
All is calm, all is well  
Soon you'll hear Kris Kringle and the jingle bells.
Bringing old toy trains, little toy tracks  
Little toy drums coming from a sack  
Carried by a man dressed in white and red  
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed?
Close your eyes  
Listen to the skies  
All is calm, all is well  
Soon you'll hear Kris Kringle and the jingle bells.

To hear the news the angels bring  
On Christmas night all Christians sing  
To hear the news the angels bring  
News of great joy, news of great mirth  
News of our merciful King's birth.
Then why should men on earth be sad  
Since our Redeemer made us glad  
Then why should we on earth be sad  
Since our Redeemer made us glad  
When from our sin, He set us free  
All for to gain our liberty.
When sin departs before Your grace  
Then life and health come in its place  
When sin departs before Your grace  
Then life and health come in its place  
Angels and men with joy may sing  
All for to see the newborn King.
All out of darkness we have light  
Which made the angels sing this night  
All out of darkness we have light  
Which made the angels sing this night  
"Glory to God and peace to men  
Now and forevermore. Amen."

As I am walking 
Surrounded by night 
Stars high above me 
Make a wish under moonlight.
On my way home 
I remember 
Only good days 
I'm on my way home 
I can remember  
Every new day.
I move in silence 
With each step taken 
Snow falling round me 
Like angels in flight 
Far in the distance 
Is my wish under moonlight.
On my way home 
I remember 
Only good days 
On my way home  
I remember  
All the best days 
I'm on my way home  
I can remember  
Every new day.
On my way home  
I remember  
All the good days.
On my way home  
I remember  
All the best days 
I'm on my way home  
I can remember  
Every new day.



With the song children sing 
To the Lord, Christ our King 
Born on earth to save us 
Him the Father gave us.
Chorus: 
Id-e-o-o-o id-e-o-o-o 
Id-e-o gloria in excelsis Deo!
His the doom, ours the mirth 
When he came down to earth 
Bethlehem saw his birth 
Ox and ass beside him 
From the cold would hide him.
Chorus: 
Id-e-o-o-o id-e-o-o-o 
Id-e-o gloria in excelsis Deo!
God's bright star, o'er his head 
Wise Men three to him led 
Kneel they low by his bed 
Lay their gifts before him 
Praise him and adore him.
Chorus: 
Id-e-o-o-o id-e-o-o-o 
Id-e-o gloria in excelsis Deo!
On this day angels sing 
With their song earth shall ring 
Praising Christ, heaven's King 
Born on earth to save us 
Peace and love he gave us.
Chorus: 
Id-e-o-o-o id-e-o-o-o 
Id-e-o gloria in excelsis Deo!

Stood a lowly cattle shed  
Where a mother laid her Baby  
In a manger for His bed 
Mary was that mother mild  
Jesus Christ her little Child.
He came down to earth from Heaven  
Who is God and Lord of all  
And His shelter was a stable  
And His cradle was a stall  
With the poor and mean and lowly  
Lived on earth our Savior holy.
And, through all His wondrous childhood  
He would honor and obey  
Love and watch the lowly maiden  
In whose gentle arms He lay  
Christian children all must be  
Mild, obedient, good as He.
For He is our childhood's pattern  
Day by day, like us He grew  
He was little, weak and helpless  
Tears and smiles like us He knew  
And He feeleth for our sadness  
And He shareth in our gladness.
And our eyes at last shall see Him  
Through His own redeeming love  
For that Child so dear and gentle  
Is our Lord in Heav'n above  
And He leads His children on  
To the place where He is gone.
Not in that poor lowly stable  
With the oxen standing by  
We shall see Him but in Heaven  
Set at God's right hand on high  
Where like stars His children crowned  
All in white shall wait around.

So Joseph found a stable in which Mary had her child  
Once upon a Christmas was the birth of Jesus Christ.
Once upon a Christmas in a manger far away  
A King was born His palace was a manger filled with hay  
His royal robe was swaddling cloth, a halo was His crown  
Once upon a Christmas away in Bethlehem.
And all the world rejoiced because the King was born at last  
A savior had been promised now it had come to pass  
And the joyful news that He was born, spread quickly far and wide  
Once upon a Christmas, was the birth of Jesus Christ.
Once upon a Christmas from the Far East wise men came  
With gold and myrrh and frankincense to praise the newborn King  
And shepherds left their flocks and came to see and worship Him  
Once upon a Christmas away in Bethlehem.
And all the world rejoiced because the King was born at last  
A savior had been promised now it had come to pass  
And the joyful news that He was born spread quickly far and wide  
Once upon a Christmas was the birth of Jesus Christ.
Once upon a Christmas far away in Bethlehem.

Things I almost remember  
And a song someone sings  
Once upon a December.
Someone holds me safe and warm  
Horses prance through a silver storm  
Figures dancing gracefully  
Across my memory.
Someone holds me safe and warm  
Horses prance through a silver storm  
Figures dancing gracefully  
Across my memory.
Far away, long ago  
Glowing dim as an ember  
Things my heart  
Used to know  
Things it yearns to remember.
And a song  
Someone sings  
Once upon a December.

One little Christmas tree that never had grown 
Cried as he looked up to the sky.
Oh please, Mr. Father Tree, the tallest of all 
I'm so afraid and alone 
Could one little Christmas tree so tiny and small 
Light up someone's home? 
Cause one little Christmas tree can light up a home 
So, one little child can find a toy 
One little Christmas tree can light up a home 
So, one little heart can find some joy.
One little angel who was riding a star 
Cried as she looked down at the tree 
Oh please, Mr. Father Tree wherever you are 
May I give him the star you gave to me?
Then in the heavens came a voice from afar 
A voice that was heard throughout the world 
"Go down little angel girl and give him your star 
Tonight he'll light the world." 

Cause one little Christmas tree can light up the world 
So those who are lost may find their way 
One little Christmas tree can light up the world 
So all men may see you on Christmas Day.






One small dream of a Savior tonight 
One small hand reaching out to the starlight 
One small Savior of life 
Ooooh. 
One king bringing his gold and his riches 
One king ruling an army of might 
One king kneeling with incense and candlelight 
One King bringing us life 
Ooooh.

See Him lying, a cradle beneath Him 
See Him smiling in the stall 
See His mother praising His Father 
See His tiny eyelids fall.
See the shepherds kneeling before Him 
See the kings on bended knee 
See the mother praising the Father 
See the Blessed Infant sleep.
One small child in a land of a thousand 
One small dream of a Savior tonight 
One small hand reaching out to the starlight 
One small Savior of life 
Ooooh. 

One toy soldier on his own  
With his drum to keep the time.
He keeps the beat of marching feet  
He keeps the beat so true  
He's one small toy for one small boy  
But his heart is, oh! so blue. 
Who can mend my broken drum?  
Will it be as good as new?  
I must play when morning comes  
If I don't, what shall I do? 
He keeps the beat of marching feet  
He keeps the beat inside  
While children sleep, in dreams so deep  
There's a secret he must hide.
For he keeps the beat of marching feet  
He keeps the beat so true  
He wants to sing and hopes to bring  
Happy Christmas day to you.
He keeps the beat of marching feet  
He keeps the beat inside  
Someone has come to mend his drum  
Now his heart lights up with pride.
So, he keeps the beat of marching feet  
He keeps the beat so true  
When morning comes  
He plays his drum.
Happy Christmas day to you!  
Happy Christmas day to you!  
Happy Christmas day to you! 
Holidays are here again!  
Holidays are here again!  
Holidays are here again!  
Holidays are here again!

To young and old 
Meek and the bold.

From everywhere  
Filling the air.

Gaily they ring

Songs of good cheer  
Christmas is here. 
Merry merry merry merry Christmas 
Merry merry merry merry Christmas 
On and on they send  
On without end 
Their joyful tone to every home.

Sweet silver bells 
All seem to say 
"Throw cares away" 
Christmas is here  
Bringing good cheer 
To young and old 
Meek and the bold.
Ding-dong, ding-dong 
That is their song 
With joyful ring  
All caroling 
One seems to hear 
Words of good cheer 
From everywhere  
Filling the air.

Gaily they ring 
While people sing 
Songs of good cheer  
Christmas is here. 
Merry merry merry merry Christmas 
Merry merry merry merry Christmas 
On and on they send  
On without end 
Their joyful tone to every home.

Diiiiing (oh-oh), doooong (oh-oh) 
Diiiiing (oh-oh), doooong (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) 
Diiiiiing (oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh) doooong (oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

To Grandmother's house we go 
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh  
Through white and drifted snow. 
Over the river and through the woods 
Oh, how the wind does blow 
It stings the toes and bites the nose  
As over the ground we go. 
Over the river and through the woods 
To have a full day of play 
Oh, hear the bells ringing ting-a-ling-ling 
For it is Christmas Day. 
Over the river and through the woods 
Trot fast my dapple gray 
Spring o'er the ground just iike a hound 
For this is Christmas Day. 
Over the river and through the woods  
And straight through the barnyard gate 
It seems that we go so dreadfully slow 
It is so hard to wait. 
Over the river and through the woods 
Now Grandma's cap I spy 
Hurrah for fun; the pudding's done 
Hurrah for the pumpkin pie.

Robin, bring your flute and come  
Aren't they fun to play upon?  
Tu-re-lu-re-lu, pat-a-pat-a-pan  
When you play your fife and drum  
How can anyone be glum?
When the men of olden days  
Gave the King of Kings their praise  
They had pipes to play upon  
Tu-re-lu-re-lu, pat-a-pat-a-pan  
And also the drums they'd play  
Full of joy, on Christmas Day.
God and man today become  
Closely joined as flute and drum  
Let the joyous tune play on  
Tu-re-lu-re-lu, pat-a-pat-a-pan  
As the instruments you play  
We will sing, this Christmas Day.

Those are the stories that are well known  
To all little girls and boys. 
But I've got another story 
That I bet you haven't heard 
Did you know that Santa 
Has a secret agent bird? 
He's Penguin, James Penguin 
That dapper little guy 
Like a well dressed duck in a three piece tux 
He's Santa's secret spy.
Have you ever wondered 
How Santa Clause keeps tabs? 
How he knows when you've been good 
How he knows when you've been bad? 
He's Penguin, James Penguin 
That dapper little guy 
Like a well dressed duck in a three piece tux 
He's Santa's secret spy.
From an undisclosed location 
He's watching me and you 
He's got satellite up links in his cuff links 
Yeah, he sees everything you do. 
He's Penguin, James Penguin 
That dapper little guy 
Like a well dressed duck in a three piece tux 
He's Santa's secret spy.
Not so very long ago 
Santa didn't need much help 
But with more and more kids every year 
He soon got overwhelmed. 
He told the elves one Christmas 
"We can't do this anymore" 
Then a knight in shining polyester 
Waddled through his door. 
And it was Penguin, James Penguin 
He was there to save the day 
He had wireless 
And GPS outfitted on the sleigh. 
And Santa said, "Penguin 
Won't you be my ears and eyes? 
How'd you like to help me run 
My SCFBI. 
He's Penguin, James Penguin 
And now I guess you've heard 
How Santa got his little Christmas 
Secret Agent Bird. 

The time is near  
Of the crowning of the year 
Make your house fair as you are able 
Trim the hearth and set the table 
People, look east and sing today 
Love, the guest, is on the way.
Furrows, be glad 
Though earth is bare 
One more seed is planted there 
Give up your strength the seed to nourish 
That in course the flower may flourish 
People, look east and sing today 
Love, the rose, is on the way.
Birds, though you long have ceased to build 
Guard the nest that must be filled 
Even the hour when wings are frozen 
God for fledging time has chosen 
People, look east and sing today 
Love, the bird, is on the way.
Stars, keep the watch 
When night is dim 
One more light the bowl shall brim 
Shining beyond the frosty weather 
Bright as sun and moon together 
People, look east and sing today 
Love, the star, is on the way.
Angels, announce with shouts of mirth 
Christ who brings new life to earth 
Set every peak and valley humming 
With the word, the Lord is coming 
People, look east and sing today 
Love, the Lord, is on the way.

La neige étend son manteau blanc 
Et les yeux levés vers le ciel 
À	 genoux, les petits enfants 
Avant de fermer les paupières 
Font une dernière prière.
Petit Papa Noël 
Quand tu descendras du ciel 
Avec des jouets par milliers 
N'oublie pas mon petit soulier 
Mais avant de partir 
Il faudra bien te couvrir 
Dehors tu vas avoir si froid 
C'est un peu À	cause de moi.
Il me tarde tant que le jour se lève 
Pour voir si tu m'as apporté 
Tous les beaux joujoux que je vois en rêves 
Et que je t'ai commandés.
Petit Papa Noël 
When you sail down from the sky 
Bringing toys, so shiny and so bright 
Please don't pass my little stocking by; 
Before you leave your home 
Wear your bright red coat so warm 
On this cold and snowy winter night 
How I pray you'll see my candlelight.
I can hardly sleep, 'cause my heart is singing 
Listening to a new Christmas song 
I can't wait to see what the morning's bringing 
Oh, Ive been waiting so long.
Petit Papa Noël 
Quand tu descendras du ciel 
Avec des jouets par milliers 
N'oublies pas mon petit soulier 
Petit Papa Noël.

Red striped candy, nut cracker handy 
Kettle a-bubbling hot as can be. 
Snow clouds hang low and threatening 
Maybe it won't, praying it may 
The brightest fireplace glows in every face 
Waiting for Christmas day.
There'll be walk-a-round songs  
And talk-a-round songs 
Songs of the inn and stable 
There'll be morning time songs  
And evening time songs 
And grace at every table 
And jingle bells will jingle all the way all day.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
Everywhere you go 
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel 
One in the park as well 
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow. 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
Soon the bells will start 
And the thing that will make them ring 
Is the carol that you sing 
Right within your heart.

Please Daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas  
I don't wanna see my Mamma cry.
Just last year, when I was only seven  
And now I'm almost eight as you can see  
You came home at a quarter past eleven  
Fell down underneath our Christmas tree.
Please Daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas  
I don't wanna see my Mamma cry  
Please Daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas  
I don't wanna see my Mamma cry.
Mamma smiled and looked outside the window  
She told me "Son, you better go upstairs"  
Then you laughed and hollered "Merry Christmas"  
I turned around and saw my Mamma's tears.
Please Daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas  
I don't wanna see my Mamma cry  
Please Daddy, don't get drunk this Christmas  
I don't wanna see my Mamma cry  
No, I don't wanna see my Mamma cry!

Wrap your presents to your darling from you;   
Pretty pencils to write, I love you  
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue. 
Crowded streets, busy feet hustle by him   
Downtown shoppers, Christmas is nigh   
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk   
Hoping that you won't pass him by.
Should you stop? Better not, much too busy    
You're in a hurry, my! how time does fly    
In the distance the ringing of laughter    
And in the midst of the laughter he cries. 
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue    
Wrap your presents to your darling from you    
Pretty pencils to write, I love you   
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue.

If you need help believing 'cause your spirit ain't too strong  
Hold my hand, we'll push that cloud away.
Put a little holiday in your heart  
It'll put a little shuffle in your step  
Give you a song, that you can sing  
With a melody you can't forget  
And if you wanna join in a little harmony  
To keep the world from tearin' apart  
Well, you know where to look  
Yeah, you gotta put a little holiday in your heart.
There's a man on the corner  
Who doesn't have a name  
People pass and turn their heads away;  
But to share a simple kindness  
Would set their heart aflame  
And you'll get more than you'll ever give away. 
Put a little holiday in your heart  
It'll put a little shuffle in your step  
Give you a song that you can sing  
With a melody you can't forget  
And if you wanna join in a little harmony  
To keep the world from tearin' apart  
Well, you know where to look  
Yeah, you gotta put a little holiday in your heart.
It starts with you, it starts with me  
This ain't no stranger, he's family  
And it don't matter if we don't agree  
It all comes down to love.
Put a little holiday in your heart  
It'll put a little shuffle in your step  
Give you a song that you can sing  
With a melody you can't forget  
And if you wanna join in a little harmony  
To keep the world from tearin' apart  
Well, you know where to look  
Yeah, you gotta put a little holiday in your heart.

Threw his old pack right over his back 
Opened the windows of his little shack 
And shouted "Oh Dasher and Dancer 
Vixen and Blitzen, come on here 
We're gonna get a-goin' and spread some cheer 
So limber your legs and sharpen your hooves 
'Cause tonight is the night  
We're gonna jump on the roof. 
Well, the reindeer they were so proud and grand  
To take another trip all over the land  
They jumped right into their proper place  
To get hepped up for that midnight race.
Ol' Santa he shook off the ice and snow  
Boarded his sleigh and then yelled "Let's go"   
All the little toys were happy too 
Because they were so bright and new 
A little piano then started to play 
Santa began to swing and sway  
Thought he heard a toy drum startin' to beat 
But he found it was the rhythm of the reindeers' feet. 
The reindeer boogied in the middle of the road  
Tonight we have a mighty big load 
Don't boogie to the left, now boogie to the right 
Do the reindeer boogie this Christmas Eve night. 
The reindeer boogied in the middle of the road 
Tonight we have a mighty big load  
Don't boogie to the left, now boogie to the right  
Do the reindeer boogie this Christmas Eve night.

Rise up, shepherd, and follow  
It will lead to the place where the Christ was born 
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.
Follow, follow, rise up, shepherd, and follow 
Follow the Star of Bethlehem 
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.
If you take good heed to the angel's words 
Rise up, shepherd, and follow 
You'll forget your flocks, you'll forget your herds 
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.
Follow, follow, rise up, shepherd, and follow 
Follow the Star of Bethlehem 
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.


They're putting up reindeer   
And singing songs of joy and peace   
Oh I wish I had a river   
I could skate away on. 
But it don't snow here   
It stays pretty green   
I'm going to make a lot of money   
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene   
Oh I wish I had a river   
I could skate away on. 
I wish I had a river so long   
I would teach my feet to fly   
I wish I had a river   
I could skate away on   
I made my baby cry. 
He tried hard to help me   
You know, he put me at ease   
And he loved me so naughty   
Made me weak in the knees   
Oh, I wish I had a river   
I could skate away on. 
I'm so hard to handle   
I'm selfish and I'm sad   
Now I've gone and lost the best baby   
That I ever had   
I wish I had a river   
I could skate away on. 
Oh, I wish I had a river so long   
I would teach my feet to fly   
I wish I had a river   
I could skate away on   
I made my baby say goodbye. 
It's coming on Christmas   
They're cutting down trees   
They're putting up reindeer   
And singing songs of joy and peace   
I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on.

At the Christmas party hop  
Mistletoe hung where you can see  
Every couple tries to stop. 
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Let the Christmas spirit ring  
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie  
And we'll do some caroling. 
You'll get a sentimental  
Feeling when you hear  
Voices singing let's be jolly 
Deck the halls with boughs of holly. 
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Have a happy holiday  
Everyone dancing merrily  
In the new old-fashioned way.

And if I don't get it, I'm gonna be blue 
I wanna rockin' little Christmas with you. 
I don't want no tinker toys 
Don't wanna waste my time drinkin' with the boys 
There's only one thing that I wanna do 
I wanna rockin' little Christmas with you. 
I want a rockin' little Christmas 
Rockin' little Christmas with you 
And if I get my wishes, it's gonna be delicious 
A stockin' full of love for two. 
Well, I've been a good boy all year 
And I deserve a little Christmas cheer 
I want your arms around me, the whole night through 
I wanna rockin' little Christmas with you. 
So baby, tell me, what's it gonna be? 
Where you gonna spend your Christmas Eve? 
And will I be merry or will I be blue? 
I wanna rockin' little Christmas with you.

And Prancer and Vixen 
Comet and Cupid 
And Donner and Blitzen 
But do you recall 
The most famous reindeer of all?
Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer 
(reindeer) 
Had a very shiny nose 
(a very shiny nose) 
And if you ever saw it 
(saw it) 
You would even say it glows 
(like a flash light).
All of the other reindeer 
(reindeer) 
Used to laugh and call him names 
(like Pinocchio) 
They never let poor Rudolph 
(Rudolph) 
Join in any reindeer games 
(like Monopoly).
Then one foggy Christmas Eve 
Santa came to say 
(Ho Ho Ho) 
"Rudolph, with your nose so bright 
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then all the reindeer loved him 
(loved him) 
As they shouted out with glee 
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer 
(reindeer) 
You'll go down in history!" 
(like Columbus).

Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town   
Santa make him hurry, he can take the freeway down   
Run, run Rudolph a whizzing like a merry-go-round.  
Said Santa to a boy child, "What have you been longing for?"    
"All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar"    
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a shooting star.
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town    
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down   
Run, run Rudolph a whizzing like a merry-go-round.
Said Santa to a girl child, "What will please you most to get?" 
"A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink and wet"   
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a Saber jet.
Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph yeah     
Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph   
Santa Claus is coming to town.
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town

Run, run Rudolph a whizzing like a merry-go-round.
Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph yeah   
Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph   
Santa Claus is coming to town.

C'mon, you can do it!   
Alright!  
Dashing through the snow in my rusty Chevrolet 
Down the road I go, sliding all the way 
I need new piston rings, I need some new snow tires 
My car is held together by a piece of chicken wire!
Oh, rust and smoke, the heater's broke, the door just blew away 
I light a match to see the dash and then I start to pray ay 
The frame is bent, the muffler went, the radio's okay 
Oh, what fun it is to drive this rusty Chevrolet!
I went to IGA, to get some Christmas cheer 
I just passed up my left front tire and it's gettin' hard to steer 
Speeding down the highway, right past the county cops 
I have to drag my swampers just to get the car to stop.
Oh, rust and smoke, the heater's broke, the door just blew away 
I light a match to see the dash and then I start to pray ay 
The frame is bent, the muffler went, the radio's okay 
Oh, what fun it is to drive this rusty Chevrolet!
Bouncing through the snowdrifts in a big, blue cloud of smoke 
People laugh as I drive by; I wonder what's the joke! 
I have to get to Walmart to pick up my layaway 
Cause Santa's comin' soon in his big, old, rusty sleigh!
Oh, rust and smoke, the heater's broke, the door just blew away 
I light a match to see the dash and then I start to pray ay 
The frame is bent, the muffler went, the radio's okay 
Oh, what fun it is to drive this rusty Chevrolet!

I'll suppose we'll be watching TV  
Yeah, and have a burger meal  
'Cause mommy she left us  
She took the keys to the automobile  
She took the credit cards and the furs  
And now we can't afford a tree .
I said sonny, it's a sad sad Christmas  
Oh boy, it's a sad sad Christmas  
Oh no, 'cause daddy, I love you anyway  
And I don't care if she has gone away  
And I love you twice as much on Christmas day  
Yeah, daddy, I love you any way.
Well, now we can't afford to celebrate the Lord  
Daddy, what a Lord? He made mother take the Ford   
But who's gonna give you your goodnight kiss  
And who's gonna clean up after this  
Daddy, don't be blue  
You know that I love you.
Yeah but sonny, it's a sad sad Christmas  
I tell you boy, it's a sad sad Christmas  
Oh no, 'cause daddy, I love you anyway  
And I don't care if she has gone away  
And I love you twice as much on Christmas day  
Yeah, daddy, I love you any way. 
Hold my hand son.
And daddy, I love you any way  
And I'm glad that you're here with me on Christmas day.  
Thank you, boy. 
And I don't care if she has gone away. 
Yeah, lets stick together 
'Cause daddy, I love you twice as much today  
Oh, you're a swell boy 
And daddy, I love you any way

I stole behind her in the frozen foods 
And I touched her on the sleeve.
She didn't recognize the face at first 
But then her eyes flew open wide 
She went to hug me and she spilled her purse 
And we laughed until we cried.
We took her groceries to the checkout stand 
The food was totaled up and bagged 
We stood there lost in our embarrassment 
As the conversation dragged.
We went to have ourselves a drink or two 
But couldn't find an open bar 
We bought a six-pack at the liquor store 
And we drank it in her car.
We drank a toast to innocence 
We drank a toast to now 
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness 
But neither one knew how.
She said she'd married her an architect 
Who kept her warm and safe and dry 
She would have liked to say she loved the man 
But she didn't like to lie. 
I said the years had been a friend to her 
And her eyes were still as blue 
But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I saw 
Doubt or gratitude.
She said she saw me in the record stores 
And that I must be doing well 
I said the audience was heavenly 
But the traveling was hell.
We drank a toast to innocence 
We drank a toast to now 
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness 
But neither one knew how.
We drank a toast to innocence 
We drank a toast to time 
Reliving in our eloquence 
Another 'auld lang syne'.
The beer was empty and our tongues were tired 
And running out of things to say 
She gave a kiss to me as I got out 
And I watched her drive away.
Just for a moment I was back at school 
And felt that old familiar pain 
And as I turned to make my way back home 
The snow turned into rain.

As white as the milk, 
And Mary bore Jesus 
All wrapped up in silk.
Chorus: 
And Mary bore Jesus  
Our Saviour for to be 
And the first tree in the greenwood 
It was the holly 
Holly! Holly! 
And the first tree in the greenwood 
It was the holly!
Now the holly bears a berry 
As green as the grass 
And Mary bore Jesus 
Who died on the cross.
Chorus: 
And Mary bore Jesus  
Our Saviour for to be 
And the first tree in the greenwood 
It was the holly 
Holly! Holly! 
And the first tree in the greenwood 
It was the holly!
Now the holly bears a berry  
As black as the coal 
And Mary bore Jesus 
Who died for us all.
Chorus: 
And Mary bore Jesus  
Our Saviour for to be 
And the first tree in the greenwood 
It was the holly 
Holly! Holly! 
And the first tree in the greenwood 
It was the holly!
Now the holly bears a berry  
As red as the blood 
Then trust we our Saviour 
Who rose from the dead.
Chorus: 
And Mary bore Jesus  
Our Saviour for to be 
And the first tree in the greenwood 
It was the holly 
Holly! Holly! 
And the first tree in the greenwood 
It was the holly!

Just slip a sable  
Under the tree for me  
Been an awful good girl  
Santa baby  
So hurry down the chimney  
Tonight.
Santa baby   
A '54 convertible too  
Light blue  
I'll wait up for you, dear  
Santa baby   
So hurry down the chimney   Tonight.
Think of all the fun I've missed  
Think of all the fellows  
I haven't kissed  
Next year I could be just as good  
If you check off my Christmas list.
Santa baby  
I want a yacht   
And really, that's not a lot  
Been an angel all year   
Santa baby  
So hurry down the chimney

To a platinum mine

So hurry down the chimney   
Tonight.
Santa cutie   
And fill my stocking   
With a duplex and checks  
Sign your x on the line   
Santa cutie  
So hurry down the chimney   
Tonight.
Come and trim my Christmas tree  
With some decorations   Bought at Tiffany's  
I really do believe in you  
Let's see if you believe in me.
Santa baby  
Forgot to mention one little thing  
A ring  
I don't mean on the phone,   
Santa baby  
So hurry down the chimney   tonight.
Hurry down the chimney tonight  
Hurry, tonight.

I don't need a lot of presents 
To make my Christmas bright 
I just need my baby's arms 
Wound around me tight 
Uh-ho, Santa hear my plea 
Santa, bring my baby back to me.
Santa, bring my baby back to me.
The Christmas tree is ready 
The candles all aglow 
But with my baby far away 
What good is mistletoe? 
Uh-ho, Santa, hear my plea 
Santa, bring my baby back to me.
Santa, bring my baby back to me.
Please, make these reindeer hurry 
Well, the time is drawing near 
It sure won't seem like Christmas 
Unless my baby's here 
Don't fill my sock with candy 
No bright and shiny toy 
You wanna make me happy 
And fill my heart with joy 
Then Santa, hear my plea 
Santa, bring my baby back to me.
Santa, bring my baby back to me.
Please, make these reindeer hurry 
Well, the time is drawing near 
It sure won't seem like Christmas 
Unless my baby's here 
Don't fill my sock with candy 
No bright and shiny toy

And fill my heart with joy 
Then Santa, hear my plea 
Santa, bring my baby back to me.
Santa, bring my baby back to me 
Santa, bring my baby back to me. 
Then Santa, hear my plea 
Santa, bring my baby back to me.

Couples holding hands, places to go 
Seems like everyone but me is in love 
Santa, can you hear me? 
I sent my letter that I sealed with a kiss 
I send it off and just said this 
I know exactly what I want this year 
Santa, can you hear me? 
I want my baby, baby 
I want someone to love me 
Someone to hold 
Maybe, maybe 
Be all my own in a big red bow 
Santa, can you hear me?

And all I want is one thing 
Tell me, my true love is here 
He's all I want  
Just for me  u
Underneath my Christmas tree 
I'll be waiting here 
Santa that's my only wish this year. 
Christmas Eve, I just can't sleep 
Will I be wrong just taking a peek? 
Cause that I heard that you're coming to town 
Santa, can you hear me?
I really hope you're on your way 
With something special for me in your sleigh 
Ooh please make my wish come true 
Santa, can you hear me?
I want my baby, baby 
I want someone to love me  
Someone to hold 
Maybe, maybe 
We'll be all alone  
Under the mistletoe.
Santa, can you hear me? 
I have been so good this year 
And all I want is one thing 
Tell me, my true love is here

In a big red bow.

Lucille runs outside    
Just to see if there might be a sleigh 
Little Bobby stares down 
At the plate where cookies still lay 
And tries to understand  
Why momma said 
"Santa can't stay". 
Chorus: 
Momma said Santa can't stay 
Said she told him that twice yesterday 
Then a car just like Dad's  
Pulled out and drove away  
After momma said 
"Santa can't stay".  
They both heard him coming  
Saw Mom run down the hall and holler, "wait! 
Doug, you're drunk!  
Don't come inside 
I'm not joking 
I've had all this I can take".  
He threw a present really hard  
That almost hit Mom's new boyfriend Ray 
And yelled "ho-ho, lucky for you she's here" 
And said that 
"Santa can't stay".  
Chorus: 
Momma said "Santa can't stay" 
Said she told him that twice yesterday 
Then a car just like Dad's  
Pulled out and drove away  
After momma said 
"Santa can't stay". 

And when it starts to snow 
The little boys and girls all know 
Soon they'll hear the sounds of your reindeer.

Now sometimes, grownups grow up to believe 
That you don't really come on Christmas Eve 
But I don't think that's true 'cause I know I've seen you 
In sparking little eyes around the tree.

Oh Santa Claus, I still believe in you 
There's still a kid inside of me that still believes you're true 
Oh Santa Claus, the kids are tucked in tight 
The hour has arrived, it's time to play ol' Santa Claus tonight.
Spoken: 
Well, I don't see how anybody could ever doubt that there really is a Santa Claus 
Especially if they've ever seen a little boy who's just got his very first bike 
Or if they've ever seen a little girl 
With her arms wrapped around her baby doll so tight  
And both of 'em waking up Mama and Daddy way before daylight 
And Grandma and Grandpa just lookin' young and lovin' life 
'Cause they know that their grand kids gonna be alright 
And Mama and Daddy, they'll be waitin' up to answer ol' Santa's call 
'Cause tonight they're not worried about payin' bills 
Lord, they're just lovin' it all!
Oh Santa Claus, I still believe in you 
There's still a kid in all of us that still believes you're true 
Oh Santa Claus, the kids are sleepin' tight 
We're turnin' out the lights and I'll be waiting up for you tonight.
Oh Santa Claus, the kids are tucked in tight 
Santa Claus, turnin' out the lights 
Oh Santa Claus 
I still believe in you.

You better not cry 
Better not pout 
I'm telling you why 
Santa Claus is coming to town.
He's making a list 
And checking it twice 
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice 
Santa Claus is coming to town.
He sees you when you're sleeping 
He knows when you're awake 
He knows if you've been bad or good 
So be good, for goodness sake!
Oh, you better watch out 
You better not cry 
Better not pout, I'm telling you why 
Santa Claus is coming to town 
Santa Claus is coming to town.

That I couldn't believe   
I went for a walk   
As the snow came down   
And when it stopped  
I was in a different town  
And the sign said,   
"Have no fear;   
You're not lost,   
You're here!"
Walkin' this Christmas   
Down Santa Claus lane   
No need to wonder   
No need to explain   
Just have some faith   
In what you see   
You're right here   
Where you wanna be   
Walkin' this Christmas   
Down Santa Claus lane   
Down Santa Claus lane.
Elves were standing in the street   
Snow men and reindeer came out to greet   
Silver bells chimed from far away   
As Santa rode by on an open sleigh  
And he told me,   
"Have no fear   
You're not lost   
You're here!"  
Walkin' this Christmas   
Down Santa Claus lane   
No need to wonder   
No need to explain   
Just have some faith   
In what you see   
You're right here   
Where you wanna be   
Walkin' this Christmas   
Down Santa Claus lane   
Down Santa Claus lane.
I don't know how   
I don't know when    
But one day   
I'll be back again. 
And he told me,  
"Have no fear   
You're not lost  
You're here." 
Walkin' this Christmas   
Down Santa Claus lane   
No need to wonder   
No need to explain   
Just have some faith   
In what you see   
You're right here   
Where you wanna be   
Walkin' this Christmas   
Down Santa Claus lane. 

I don't know how I noticed the piece of paper at my feet  
But somethin' made me pick it up, instead of goin' on my way  
I stopped and froze right in my tracks  
As I read what it had to say:

"Oh Santa, if you can't find me  
We're livin' out here on the street  
But I'll be watchin' for you   
You're not gonna forget me, are you?  
Daddy says he knows you'll try  
But we might be too hard to find this year  
Oh Santa, I'm right here". 
It said, "We don't have our house no more  
I wish we could go home  
Mama says we will some day and she prays it won't be long   
But they closed daddy's factory and took most of our things  
Now Santa, I don't need to much, so this year could you bring  
Bring my mom a coat that's warm   
Cause the one she's got is awful torn   
Maybe dad could help you work, makin' toys for boys and girls".
"Oh Santa, if you can't find me  
We're livin' out here on the street  
But I'll be watchin' for you   
You're not gonna forget me, are you?  
Daddy says he knows you'll try  
But we might be too hard to find this year  
Oh Santa, I'm right here". 
"I'm right here   
I'm right here".

It's not the way I had him pictured 
Santa was a' much too thin.
He didn't come down the chimney 
So momma must have let him in 
Santa looked a lot like daddy 
Or daddy looked a lot like him.
Well, they thought I was fast a' sleepin', 
They thought that I was tucked in bed 
They never thought I'd come a' peepin' 
Or that I'd hear what was said.
Santa put his arm around momma 
And momma put her arm around him 
So if Santa Claus ain't daddy 
Then I'm a gonna tell on them.
Santa looked like daddy 
Or daddy looked like him 
It's not the way I had him pictured 
Santa was a' much too thin.
He didn't come down the chimney 
So momma must have let him in 
Santa looked a lot like daddy 
Or daddy looked a lot like him.
I never saw Dancer or Prancer 
I never heard the sleigh bells ring 
I never saw the red nosed reindeer 
Like they show on the TV screen.
But he sure brought lots of presents 
So Santa Claus, he must have been 
Well, he sure looked a lot like daddy 
Or daddy looked a lot like him.
Santa looked like daddy 
Or daddy looked like him 
It's not the way I had him pictured 
Santa was a' much too thin.
He didn't come down the chimney 
So momma must have let him in 
Santa looked a lot like daddy 
Or daddy looked a lot like him.
Santa looked like daddy 
Or daddy looked like him 
It's not the way I had him pictured 
Santa was a' much too thin.
He didn't come down the chimney 
So momma must have let him in 
Santa looked a lot like daddy 
Or daddy looked a lot like him.

Santa looked a lot like daddy 
And daddy looked a lot like him.






She's with him now  
I'm with my loneliness. 
She ran away 
Four months ago 
Left in his sleigh  
For the north pole 
Please come back home  
And leave that fat man alone. 
Santa, you bitch 
Didn't get a damn thing  
From my Christmas list 
All I got was this broken heart  
And that's it.  
Santa, you bitch 
Oh, there's only one thing that I truly wish 
I wish my old girl  
Would've never kissed Saint Nick 
Would've never kissed Saint Nick. 

I saw them dancing under mistletoe 
Thought it was nothing  
But I guess I didn't know 
Guess I didn't know 
That there was something going on with them 
Santa, you player, I thought we were friends. 
Please come back home  
And leave that fat man alone. 

Santa, you bitch 
Didn't get a damn thing  
From my Christmas list 
All I got was this broken heart  
And that's it.  
Santa, you bitch 
Oh, there's only one thing that I truly wish 
I wish my old girl  
Would've never kissed Saint Nick 
Would've never kissed Saint Nick. 
Santa, you bitch 
Didn't get a damn thing  
From my Christmas list 
All I got was this broken heart  
And that's it.  
Santa, you bitch 
Oh, there's only one thing that I truly wish 
I wish my old girl  
Would've never kissed.
Santa, you bitch 
Didn't get a damn thing  
From my Christmas list 
All I got was this broken heart  
And that's it.  
Santa, you bitch 
Oh, there's only one thing that I truly wish 
I wish my old girl  
Would've never kissed Saint Nick.

I wanna meet Santa Claus   
The real real Santa  
I wanna see Santa Claus   
The real real Santa"  
He wants to meet ol' Santa Claus.
I took my brother to the department store  
He wanted to show Santa his Christmas list  
He stood in line and he shook like a leaf  
He's only five and a half goin' on six.
He said, "Is that really Santa Claus  
Really really Santa Claus?  
(That Santa)  
(The real Santa) 
Is that really Santa Claus  
Really really Santa?  
(That Santa)  
(I hope he doesn't pull Santa's beard) 
Is that really Santa Claus  
Really really Santa?"  
(That Santa)  
(The real Santa) 
Hope he thinks that's Santa Claus.
I picked him up and put him on Santa's lap  
And then he pulled the pillow out of his shirt  
He yanked the beard right off of his chin  
And in his eyes I could see he was hurt.
He said, "You're not really Santa Claus 
You're really not Santa Claus  
(Not Santa)  
(The real Santa) 
You're not really Santa Claus 
You're really not Santa  
(Not Santa)  
(He shouldn'ta pulled Santa's beard) 
You're not Santa Claus  
You're really not Santa"  
(Not Santa)  
(The real Santa)
He's just helpin' Santa Claus

He's just helpin' Santa Claus. 

Cause we live way down south 
And it didn't snow down here 
But, I'm telling you not to worry 
Cause I just got the word 
Everybody listen closely  
And I'll tell you what I heard.
Santa's comin' in a pickup 
Instead of his trusty sleigh  
He'll have a truck instead of reindeer 
To carry him on his way 
Cause the weatherman had some problems 
He couldn't get snow you see 
Santa's gonna come in a pickup truck 
When he visits you and me.
Santa can't bring his reindeer 
He'll leave them far away 
But don't you worry 'bout him 
He's gonna be here Christmas day 
He's got a big red pickup 
With four-wheel drive and all 
And there's gonna be a Merry Christmas 
A Merry Christmas for all.
Santa's gonna come in a pick up truck 
When he visits you and me.


Not a sound heard anywhere 
But the silence was broken  
When these words were spoken 
"Hey, get me outta here!"
Push!! 
Tug!! 
Pull!! 
Shove!!
Santa's stuck up in the chimney 
In the chimney 
We gotta  
Push!! 
Tug!! 
Pull! 
Shove!! 
There'll be no Christmas  
Till we set him free.
That's when he started to diet 
Through the summer 
He stuck by it 
But his appetite 
Was fated to win 
Because his wife started bakin' 
And Christmas candy makin' 
Now look at the shape he's in.
We gotta 
Push!! 
Tug!! 
Pull! 
Shove!!
Santa's stuck up in the chimney 
In the chimney 
We gotta  
Push!! 
Tug!! 
Pull! 
Shove!! 
There'll be no Christmas  
Till we set him free.
This's becomin' a disaster 
If we don't free faster 
Day will dawn 
And children everywhere will weep 
The house is full of neighbours tryin' 
Down to havin' children cryin' 
"Get him out of here 
So I can get some sleep!"
We gotta 
Push!! 
Tug!! 
Pull! 
Shove!!
Santa's stuck up in the chimney 
In the chimney 
We gotta  
Push!! 
Tug!! 
Pull! 
Shove!!
Push!! 
Tug!! 
Pull! 
Shove!! 
There'll be no Christmas  
Till we set him free.
Cos Santa's stuck up in the chimney!


Now we have walked in the chill of the night 
We are waiting for, waiting for 
For the Saviour's day.
Many have come from the valleys 
Many have come from the hills 
Many have started their journey home 
To be with someone, with someone 
On the Saviour's day.
Open your eyes on Saviour's day 
Don't look back or turn away 
Life can be yours if you'll only stay 
He is calling you, calling you 
On the Saviour's day.
Joining the old and the young ones 
Joining the black and the white 
Meeting the need of the hungry is he 
We will ever remember him 
On the Saviour's day.
Open your eyes on Saviour's day 
Don't look back or turn away 
Life can be yours if you'll only stay 
He is calling you, calling you 
On the Saviour's day. 
Here's to the God of the present 
Here's to the God of the past 
Here's to the hope in the future he brings 
We will sing to him, sing to him 
On the Savior's day.
Open your eyes on Saviour's day 
Don't look back or turn away 
Life can be yours if you'll only stay 
He is calling you, calling you 
On the Saviour's day. 
On the Saviour's day 
On the Saviour's day 
He is calling you 
On the Saviour's day

Born for us on earth below, 
See, the gentle Lamb appears, 
Promised from eternal years.
Refrain: 
Hail that ever blessed morn, 
Hail redemption's happy dawn, 
Sing through all Jerusalem: 
"Christ is born in Bethlehem."
Lo, within a manger lies 
He who built the starry skies; 
He who, throned in height sublime, 
Sits amid the cherubim.
Refrain: 
Hail that ever blessed morn, 
Hail redemption's happy dawn, 
Sing through all Jerusalem: 
"Christ is born in Bethlehem."
Say, you holy shepherds, say, 
Tell your joyful news today 
Why have you now left your sheep 
On the lonely mountain steep?
Refrain: 
Hail that ever blessed morn, 
Hail redemption's happy dawn, 
Sing through all Jerusalem: 
"Christ is born in Bethlehem."
As we watched at dead of night, 
Lo, we saw a wondrous light; 
Angels singing "Peace on earth" 
Told us of the Savior's birth.
Refrain: 
Hail that ever blessed morn, 
Hail redemption's happy dawn, 
Sing through all Jerusalem: 
"Christ is born in Bethlehem."
Sacred Infant, all divine, 
What a tender love was Thine, 
Thus to come from highest bliss 
Down to such a world as this.
Refrain: 
Hail that ever blessed morn, 
Hail redemption's happy dawn, 
Sing through all Jerusalem: 
"Christ is born in Bethlehem."
Teach, O teach us, holy Child, 
By Thy face so meek and mild, 
Teach us to resemble Thee, 
In Thy sweet humility.
Refrain: 
Hail that ever blessed morn, 
Hail redemption's happy dawn, 
Sing through all Jerusalem: 
"Christ is born in Bethlehem."

All is calm, all is bright 
Round yon virgin mother and Child. 
Holy Infant, so tender and mild 
Sleep in heavenly peace 
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Silent night, holy night 
Shepherds quake at the sight 
Glories stream from heaven afar 
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia! 
Christ the Savior is born 
Christ the Savior is born!
Silent night, holy night 
Son of God, love's pure light 
Radiant beams from Thy holy face 
With the dawn of redeeming grace 
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth 
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.
Silent night, holy night 
Wondrous star, lend thy light 
With the angels let us sing 
Alleluia to our King 
Christ the Savior is born 
Christ the Savior is born!
German: Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht
Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht 
Alles schläft; einsam wacht 
Nur das traute hochheilige Paar 
Holder Knabe im lockigen Haar 
Schlaf in himmlischer Ruh! 
Schlaf in himmlischer Ruh!
Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht 
Hirten erst kundgemacht 
Durch der Engel Halleluja 
Tönt es laut von fern und nah 
Christ, der Retter ist da! 
Christ, der Retter ist da!
Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht 
Gottes Sohn, o wie lacht 
Lieb' aus deinem göttlichen Mund 
Da uns schlägt die rettende Stund' 
Christ, in deiner Geburt! 
Christ, in deiner Geburt!

Ev'ryone wishes for silver and gold  
How do you measure its worth?  
Just by the pleasure it gives here on earth.
Silver and gold, silver and gold   
Mean so much more when I see   
Silver and gold decorations   
On ev'ry Christmas tree.
Spoken 
What's a Christmas tree without tinsel  
And pretty silver and gold decorations?  
Can't really call it a Christmas tree now  
Can you?  
And think of all the fun and joy 
That would be lost on Christmas morning  
If all the young folks didn't get to see  
That sparkling happy tree.
Silver and gold, silver and gold   
Mean so much more when I see   
Silver and gold decorations   
On ev'ry Christmas tree.

It may bring parties or thoughts devotional  
Whatever happens or what may be 
Here is what Christmas time means to me.
City sidewalk, busy sidewalks 
Dressed in holiday style 
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas.
Children laughing, people passing 
Meeting smile after smile 
And on every street corner you'll hear:
Silver bells, silver bells 
It's Christmas time in the city 
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring 
Soon it will be Christmas day.
City street lights 
Even stop lights 
Blink a bright red and green 
As the shoppers rush home 
With their treasures.
Hear the snow crunch 
See the kids bunch 
This is Santa's big scene 
And above all this bustle you'll hear:
Silver bells, silver bells 
It's Christmas time in the city 
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring 
Soon it will be Christmas day.

Was far from home and lost in a great big zoo  
"Mummy, where's my mummy? They've taken her away"  
"We'll help you find your mummy son, hop on the sleigh". 
Up beside the bag of toys, little Joey hopped  
But they hadn't gone far when Santa stopped  
Unharnessed all the reindeer and Joey wondered why  
Then he heard a far off booming in the sky.  
Chorus:  
Six white boomers, snow white boomers  
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun  
Six white boomers, snow white boomers  
On his Australian run.
Pretty soon old Santa began to feel the heat  
Took his fur-lined boots off to cool his feet.  
Into one popped Joey, feeling quite OK  
While those old man kangaroos kept pulling on the sleigh.
Chorus:  
Six white boomers, snow white boomers  
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun  
Six white boomers, snow white boomers  
On his Australian run.
Joey said to Santa, "Santa, what about the toys  
Aren't you giving some to these girls and boys?"  
"They've all got their presents son, we were here last night  
This trip is an extra trip, Joey's special flight."
Chorus:  
Six white boomers, snow white boomers  
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun  
Six white boomers, snow white boomers  
On his Australian run.
Soon the sleigh was flashing past, right over Marble Bar  
"Slow down there," cried Santa, "It can't be far.  
Come up on my lap son, and have a look around."  
"There she is, that's mummy, bounding up and down."
Chorus:  
Six white boomers, snow white boomers  
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun  
Six white boomers, snow white boomers  
On his Australian run.
Well that's the bestest Christmas treat that Joey ever had  
Curled up in mother's pouch all snug and glad.  
The last they saw was Santa headed northward from the sun  
The only year the boomers worked a double run.
Chorus:  
Six white boomers, snow white boomers  
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun  
Six white boomers, snow white boomers  
On his Australian run.

Wherever you are 
Tomorrow is Christmas 
Beneath every star.
Soon the snowflakes will fall 
And tomorrow you'll see 
Every wish, one and all 
Waiting under the tree.
Sleep well, little children 
Pleasant dreams through the night 
Tomorrow is Christmas 
All merry and bright.
Soon you'll hear the bells ring 
Time for dreams to come true 
As the world wakes to bring 
Merry Christmas to you.

Ring ting tingling too 
Come on, it's lovely weather 
For a sleigh ride together with you 
Outside the snow is falling 
And friends are calling "Yoo hoo" 
Come on, it's lovely weather 
For a sleigh ride together with you.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap 
Let's go, let's look at the show 
We're riding in a wonderland of snow 
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap 
It's grand, just holding your hand 
We're gliding along with a song 
Of a wintry fairy land.
Our cheeks are nice and rosy 
And comfy cozy are we 
We're snuggled up together 
Like two birds of a feather would be 
Let's take that road before us 
And sing a chorus or two 
Come on, it's lovely weather 
For a sleigh ride together with you.
There's a birthday party 
At the home of Farmer Gray 
It'll be the perfect ending for a perfect day 
We'll be singing the songs 
We love to sing, without a single stop 
At the fireplace while we watch 
The chestnuts pop. Pop! pop! pop!
There's a happy feeling 
Nothing in the world can buy 
When they pass around the chocolate 
And the pumpkin pie 
It'll nearly be like a picture print 
By Currier and Ives 
These wonderful things are the things 
We remember all through our lives.
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling 
Ring ting tingling too 
Come on, it's lovely weather 
For a sleigh ride together with you 
Outside the snow is falling 
And friends are calling "Yoo hoo" 
Come on, it's lovely weather 
For a sleigh ride together with you.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap 
Let's go let's look at the show 
We're riding in a wonderland of snow 
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap 
It's grand, just holding your hand 
We're gliding along with a song 
Of a wintry fairy land.
Our cheeks are nice and rosy 
And comfy cozy are we 
We're snuggled up together 
Like two birds of a feather would be 
Let's take that road before us 
And sing a chorus or two 
Come on, it's lovely weather 
For a sleigh ride together with you.

(Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree)  
Du kannst mir sehr gefallen!   
(Of all the trees most lovely)
The news had come out in the First World War   
The bloody Red Baron was flying once more  
The Allied command ignored all of its men  
And called on Snoopy to do it again.
Twas the night before Christmas, 40 below  
When Snoopy went up in search of his foe  
He spied the Red Baron, fiercely they fought  
With ice on his wings, Snoopy knew he was caught.
Christmas bells, those Christmas bells  
Ring out from the land  
Asking peace of all the world  
And good will to man.
The Baron had Snoopy dead in his sights  
He reached for the trigger to pull it up tight  
Why he didn't shoot, well, we'll never know  
Or was it the bells from the village below.
Christmas bells, those Christmas bells  
Ringing through the land  
Bringing peace to all the world  
And good will to man.
The Baron made Snoopy fly to the Rhine  
And forced him to land behind the enemy lines  
Snoopy was certain that this was the end  
When the Baron cried out, "Merry Christmas, my friend".
The Baron then offered a holiday toast  
And Snoopy, our hero, saluted his host  
And then with a roar they were both on their way  
Each knowing they'd meet on some other day.
Christmas bells, those Christmas bells  
Ringing through the land  
Bringing peace to all the world  
And good will to man.
Christmas bells, those Christmas bells  
Ringing through the land  
Bringing peace to all the world  
And good will to man.

Let me thank you 
For the joy you're giving me 
I'm so happy 
I have snowflakes of love  
Smiling down on me.
Winter bliss  
When we kiss 
Every wish my lips could see 
I'm so happy 
I have snowflakes of love  
Smiling down on me. 
Snowy day 
Would you please  
Take me away? 
Away with you 
Hold me so closely 
Like the moonlight lights the sky.
In my dreams  
Soft winter breeze 
Eases my mind 
But when I wake 
There's nothing but leaves 
Still, I'm happy 
I have snowflakes of love  
Smiling down on me. 
Oh, how I imagine  
The day we met 
And those tingles  
From those little butterflies 
Reminiscing  
I get so happy 
I just break down and cry.
Candlelight  
Burning bright 
Underneath a cool, starry night 
You and me 
Endlessly 
It's the greatest gift 
That love could give to me.
On this day 
Snowy day 
Let me thank you 
For the joy you're giving me 
I'm so happy 
I have snowflakes of love  
Smiling down on me.

Does he ride a red nosed reindeer? 
Does he turn up on his sleigh 
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?
Chorus:  
So here it is, Merry Christmas 
Everybody's having fun 
Look to the future now 
It's only just begun.
Are you waiting for the family to arrive? 
Are you sure you got room to spare inside? 
Does your granny always tell you, that the old songs are the best? 
Then she's up and rock 'n' rollin' with the rest.
Chorus:  
So here it is, Merry Christmas 
Everybody's having fun 
Look to the future now 
It's only just begun.
What will your daddy do? 
When he sees your Mama kissin' Santa Claus? 
Ah ah!
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall? 
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall? 
Do you ride on down the hillside in a buggy you have made? 
When you land upon your head then you've been sleighed.
Chorus:  
So here it is, Merry Christmas 
Everybody's having fun 
Look to the future now 
It's only just begun.
Chorus:  
So here it is, Merry Christmas 
Everybody's having fun 
Look to the future now 
It's only just begun.
Chorus:  
So here it is, Merry Christmas 
Everybody's having fun 
Look to the future now 
It's only just begun.
Chorus:  
So here it is, Merry Christmas 
Everybody's having fun 
Look to the future now 
It's only just begun.


And what have you done?  
Another year over  
And a new one just begun.
And so this is Christmas  
I hope you have fun  
The near and the dear one  
The old and the young.
A very Merry Christmas  
And a Happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear.
And so this is Christmas  
For weak and for strong  
For rich and the poor ones  
The world is so wrong.
And so this is Christmas  
For black and for white  
For yellow and red ones  
Let's stop all the fight.
A very Merry Christmas  
And a Happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear.
So this is Christmas  
And what have you done?  
Another year over  
And a new one just begun.
And so this is Christmas  
I hope you have fun  
The near and the dear one  
The old and the young.
A very Merry Christmas  
And a Happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear.
War is over!  
If you want it  
War is over!  
Now!

One warm December, our hearts will see  
A world where men are free. 
Someday at Christmas, there'll be no wars  
When we have learned what Christmas is for;  
When we have found what life's really worth  
There'll be peace on earth.
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free;  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmastime.
Someday at Christmas, we'll see a man  
No hungry children, no empty hand;  
One happy morning people will share  
Our world, where people care.
Someday at Christmas, there'll be no tears  
All men are equal and no men have fears;  
One shinning moment my heart ran away  
From our world today.
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmastime 
Someday at Christmas, man will not fail  
Take hope, because your love will prevail  
Someday a new world that we can start  
With hope in every heart.
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmastime 
Someday at Christmastime.

Guiding us on to Heaven afar! 
Sorrow and grief and lulled by thy light, 
Thou hope of each mortal, in death's lonely night!
Fearless and tranquil, we look up to Thee! 
Knowing thou beamst thro' eternity! 
Help us to follow where Thou still dost guide, 
Pilgrims of earth so wide.
Star of the East, thou hope of the soul, 
While round us here the dark billows roll, 
Lead us from sin to glory afar, 
Thou star of the East, thou sweet Bethlehem's star.
Star of the East, undimmed by each cloud, 
What tho' the storms of grief gather loud? 
Faithful and pure thy rays beam to save, 
Still bright o'er the cradle, and bright o'er the grave!
Smiles of a Saviour are mirror'd in Thee! 
Glimpses of Heav'n in thy light we see! 
Guide us still onward to that blessed shore, 
After earth's toil is o'er!
Star of the East, thou hope of the soul, 
While round us here the dark billows roll, 
Lead us from sin to glory afar, 
Thou star of the East, thou sweet Bethlehem's star.
Oh star that leads to God above! 
Whose rays are peace and joy and love! 
Watch o'er us still till life hath ceased, 
Beam on, bright star, sweet Bethlehem star!

So I'm sending you this Christmas card  
To say it's nice to have you here  
I'd like to sing about all the things  
Your eyes and mind can see  
So hop aboard the turntable  
Oh, step into Christmas with me.
Step into Christmas  
Let's join together  
We can watch the snow fall  
Forever and ever  
Eat, drink and be merry  
Come along with me  
Step into Christmas  
The admission's free.
Take care in all you do next year  
And keep smiling through the days  
If we can help to entertain you  
Oh, we will find the ways  
So merry Christmas one and all  
There's no place I'd rather be  
Than asking you if you'd oblige  
Stepping into Christmas with me.

One can hear the falling snow   
For all is hushed  
The world is sleeping  
Holy Star, its vigil keeping   
Still, still, still  
One can hear the falling snow. 
Sleep, sleep, sleep  
'Tis the eve of our Saviour's birth   
The night is peaceful all around you   
Close your eyes  
Let sleep surround you   
Sleep, sleep, sleep   
'Tis the eve of our Saviour's birth. 
Dream, dream, dream  
Of the joyous day to come   
While guardian angels without number   
Watch you as you sweetly slumber   
Dream, dream, dream  
Of the joyous day to come.

But it's very cold out here in the snow 
Marching to win from the enemy.
Oh, I say it's tough 
I have had enough 
Can you stop the cavalry?
I have had to fight 
Almost every night 
Down throughout these centuries 
That is when I say 
Oh yes, yet again 
Can you stop the cavalry?
Mary Bradley waits at home 
In the nuclear fall-out zone 
Wish I could be dancing now 
In the arms of the girl I love.
Chorus: 
Dub a dub a dum dum 
Dub a dub a dum 
Dub a dum dum dub a dub 
Dub a dub a dum 
Dub a dub a dum dum 
Dub a dub a dum 
Dub a dum dum dub a dub 
Dub a dub a dum 
Wish I was at home for Christmas.
Bang! That's another bomb 
On another town 
While the Czar and Jim have tea 
If I get home alive to tell the tale 
I'll run for all presidencies 
If I get elected I'll stop  
I will stop the cavalry.
Chorus: 
Dub a dub a dum dum 
Dub a dub a dum 
Dub a dum dum dub a dub 
Dub a dub a dum 
Dub a dub a dum dum 
Dub a dub a dum 
Dub a dum dum dub a dub 
Dub a dub a dum 
Wish I was at home for Christmas.
Wish I could be dancing now 
In the arms of the girl I love 
Mary Bradley waits at home 
She has been waiting two years long 
Wish I was at home for Christmas.


Cause never in a million lives 
Would he have dreamed of Bethlehem. 
And standing at the manger 
He saw with his own eyes  
The message from the angel come to life 
And Joseph said:
"Why me, I'm just a simple man of trade? 
Why Him with all the rulers in the world?  
Why here, inside this stable filled with hay?  
Why her, she's just an ordinary girl?  
Now I'm not one to second guess  
What angels have to say  
But this is such a strange way  
To save the world." 
To think of how it could have been 
If Jesus had come as He deserved  
There would have been no Bethlehem  
No lowly shepherds at His birth. 
But Joseph knew the reason  
Love had to reach so far  
And as he held the Savior in his arms 
He must have thought: 
"Why me, I'm just a simple man of trade? 
Why Him with all the rulers in the world?  
Why here, inside this stable filled with hay?  
Why her, shes just an ordinary girl?  
Now I'm not one to second guess  
What angels have to say  
But this is such a strange way  
To save the world." 
Such a strange way, this is 
Such a strange way  
A strange way to save the world   
A strange way to save the world.

Dressed in a snow white gown; 
Tap, tap, tappin' at your window pane 
To tell you she's in town.
Here comes Suzy Snowflake 
Soon you will hear her say; 
"Come out ev'ryone and play with me 
I haven't long to stay."
"If you want to make a snowman 
I'll help you make one, two, three; 
If you wanna take a sleigh ride 
The ride's on me."
Here comes Suzy Snowflake 
Look at her tumblin' down; 
Bringing joy to every girl and boy 
Suzy's come to town.

Sweet little Jesus Boy  
They made you be born in a manger  
Sweet little Holy Child  
Didn't know who You was?

Didn't know you come to save us, Lord?  
To take our sins away  
Our eyes was blind, we couldn't see  
We didn't know who You was.
Long time ago, you was born  
Born in a manger low  
Sweet little Jesus Boy.
The world treat You mean, Lord  
Treat me mean, too  
But that's how things is down here  
We didn't know t'was You.
You done showed us how  
We is trying  
Master, You done showed us how  
Even when you's dying.
Just seem like we can't do right  
Look how we treated You.  
But please, sir, forgive us Lord  
We didn't know 'twas You.
Sweet little Jesus Boy  
Born long time ago  
Sweet little Holy Child  
And we didn't know who You was.

Can't you hear the prayers  
Of every childlike heart tonight? 
Rockies are callin', Denver snow fallin' 
Somebody said it's four feet deep  
But it doesn't matter 
Give me the laughter  
I'm gonna choose to keep:
Another tender Tennessee Christmas   
The only Christmas for me  
Where the love circles around us  
Like the gifts around our tree 
Well, I know there's more snow  
Up in Colorado 
Than my roof will ever see 
But a tender Tennessee Christmas 
Is the only Christmas for me.
Every now and then I get a wanderin' urge to see 
Maybe California, maybe Tinsel Town's for me 
There's a parade there, we'd have it made there 
Bring home a tan for new year's eve 
Sure sounds exciting, awfully inviting   
Still I think I'm gonna keep:
Another tender Tennessee Christmas   
The only Christmas for me 
Where the love circles around us  
Like the gifts around our tree 
Well they say in L.A. it's a warm holiday  
It's the only place to be 
A tender Tennessee Christmas   
Is the only Christmas for me.
Well, I know there's more snow  
Up in Colorado   
Than my roof will ever see 
But a tender Tennessee Christmas  
Is the only Christmas for me 
A tender Tennessee Christmas 
Is the only Christmas for me.


Oh my friends, it's been a long hard year 
But now, it's Christmas 
Yes, it's Christmas 
Thank God it's Christmas!
The moon and stars seem awful cold and bright 
Let's hope the snow will make this Christmas right 
My friend, the world will share this special night 
Because it's Christmas 
Yes, it's Christmas 
Thank God it's Christmas 
For one night.
Thank God it's Christmas 
Yeah! 
Thank God it's Christmas 
Thank God it's Christmas 
Can it be Christmas? 
Let it be Christmas 
Every day.
Oh my love, we've lived in troubled days 
Oh my friend, we have the strangest ways 
All my friends, on this one day of days 
Thank God it's Christmas 
Yes, it's Christmas 
Thank God it's Christmas 
For one day.
Thank God it's Christmas 
Yes, it's Christmas 
Thank God it's Christmas 
Oooh yeah! 
Thank God it's Christmas 
Yes, yes, yes, yes it's Christmas 
Thank God it's Christmas 
For one day.
A very merry Christmas to you all!

Down the stairs  
The children run. 
Someone has eaten the cookies 
And look what's left under the tree 
There's presents for you and for me 
As far as the eye can see.
What's on the rooftop?  
I wondered what that was  
Its reindeer flying 
Around the world 
Because Santa's coming 
I think we all should pause to say  
That we're grateful 
For everything he does!
Thank you Santa Claus 
Thank you Santa Claus.
A song for all the things you do 
Santa Claus we're thankin' you 
A song for all the things you do 
Santa Claus we're thankin' you 
A song for all the things you do 
(Joy to the world) 
Santa Claus we're thankin' you  
(Reindeer flyin') 
A song for all the things you do 
(Joy to the world) 
Santa Claus we're thankin' you  
(Reindeer flyin') 
Thank you Santa Claus!


Sharing so much joy and cheer 
What a wonderful feelin' 
Watching the ones we love 
Having so much fun.
I was sittin' by the fire side 
Taking a walk through the snow 
Listening to a children's choir 
Singing songs about Jesus 
The blessed way that He came to us 
Why can't it remain 
All through the year? 
Each day the same 
That's what I wanna hear 
He he  
It's truly amazin' 
That spirit of Christmas.
All the kin folk gather round 
The lovely Christmas tree 
Hearts are glowing full of joy 
Sense the gifts that we're giving 
And the love that we're living 
Why can't it remain? 
Why can't it remain? 
Oh all through the year 

Each day the same 
Each day the same 
That's what I wanna hear 
I'll tell ya 
It's truly amazin' 
That spirit of Christmas.
Let me hear ya 
Why can't it remain? 
Why can't it remain? 
All through the year 
All through the year 
Each day the same  
Each day the same 
That's what I wanna hear 
Listen to me 
It's truly amazin' 
That spirit of Christmas 
Oh, it's truly amazin' 
That spirit of Christmas 
Ain't it so? 
It's truly amazin' 
Yeah, that spirit of Christmas 
Oh Christmas 
Oh Christmas!

Here's a toast to us together 
Let me wrap you in this bow 
I'm in the Christmas spirit 
No, this one won't be blue 
It's gonna be the best one ever 
And it's all because of you, baby.
You're the angel at the top of my tree 
The best present anybody ever gave to me 
I've got it decorated, all lit up, gifts underneath 
You're the angel at the top of my tree.
Let's put on that old movie  
'It's a Wonderful Night' 
'Cause curled up by the fire 
It sure rings true tonight 
Let's make a little candy 
Then a little later on  
We'll make a little love 
To that old Bing Crosby song, baby.
You're the angel at the top of my tree 
The best present anybody ever gave to me 
I've got it decorated, all lit up, gifts underneath 
You're the angel at the top of my tree.
You're the angel at the top of my tree 
The best present anybody ever gave to me 
I've got it decorated, all lit up, gifts underneath 
You're the angel at the top of my tree.
Baby, you're the angel!

The angel Gabriel from heaven came  
With wings as drifted snow, with eyes as flame  
"All hail to thee, O lowly maiden Mary  
Most highly favored lady." Gloria! 
"For know a blessed mother thou shalt be  
All generations laud and honor thee  
Thy son shall be Emmanuel, by seers foretold  
Most highly favored lady." Gloria! 
Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head  
"To me be as it pleaseth God," she said  
"My soul shall laud and magnify God's holy name."  
"Most highly favored lady." Gloria!  
Of her, Emmanuel, the Christ, was born  
In Bethlehem, all on a Christmas morn  
And Christian folk through-out the world will ever say  
"Most highly favored lady." Gloria!

Not being sure of what it mean   
But knowing it was heaven sent 
They made their way. 
And the creatures gathered 'round  
And didn't make a sound  
And the angels cried.
The angels knew what was to come  
The reason God had sent His son  
From up above  
It filled their hearts with joy to see   
And knowing of His destiny  
Came tears of love.
And the creatures gathered 'round  
And didn't make a sound  
And the angels cried.
I've often thought about that night  
And wondered if they realized  
That star so bright  
Was sent to tell all the land  
The Son of God would soon become  
The Son of man.
And the creatures gathered 'round  
And didn't make a sound  
And the angels cried.
And the angels cried  
And the angels cried.

The happy crowds are mingling 
But there's no one that I know. 
I'm sure that you'll forgive me 
If I don't enthuse 
I guess I've got the Christmas blues.
I've done my window shopping 
There's not a store I've missed 
But what's the use of stopping 
When there's no one on your list? 
You'll know the way I'm feeling 
When you love and you lose 
I guess I've got the Christmas blues.
When somebody wants you 
Somebody needs you 
Christmas is a joy of joy; 
But friends, when you're lonely 
You'll find, that it's only 
A thing for little girls and little boys.
May all your days be merry 
Your seasons full of cheer 
But 'till it's January 
I'll just go and disappear 
Oh, Santa may have brought you  
Some stars for your shoes 
But Santa only brought me the blues 
Those brightly packaged  Tinsel covered Christmas blues. 
Oh, Santa may have brought you  
Some stars for your shoes 
But Santa only brought me the blues 
Those brightly packaged  Tinsel covered Christmas blues.

And they found his shop so meager and mean 
Made gay with a thousand boughs of green.
And Conrad was sitting with face a-shine 
When he suddenly stopped as he stitched a twine 
And he said, "Old friends, at dawn today 
When the cock was crowing the night away 
The Lord appeared in a dream to me 
And said, 'I am coming your guest to be.'
"So I've been busy with feet astir 
Strewing my shop with branches of fir 
The table is spread and the kettle is shined 
And over the rafters the holly is twined."
"And now I will wait for my Lord to appear 
And listen closely so I will hear 
His step as He nears my humble place 
And I open the door and look on His face."
So his friends went home and left Conrad alone 
For this was the happiest day he had known 
For, long since, his family had passed away 
And Conrad had spent many a sad Christmas day.
But he knew with the Lord as his Christmas guest 
This Christmas would be the dearest and best 
So he listened with only joy in his heart 
And with every sound he would rise with a start 
And look for the Lord to be at his door 
Like the vision he had a few hours before.
So, he ran to the window after hearing a sound 
But all that he could see on the snow-covered ground 
Was a shabby beggar whose shoes were torn 
And all of his clothes were ragged and worn.
But Conrad was touched and went to the door 
And he said, "Your feet must be frozen and sore 
I have some shoes in my shop for you 
And a coat that will keep you warmer, too."
So with grateful heart the man went away 
But Conrad noticed the time of day 
He wondered what made the Lord so late 
And how much longer he'd have to wait.
When he heard a knock and ran to the door 
But it was only a stranger once more 
A bent, old lady with a shawl of black 
With a bundle of kindling piled on her back.
She asked for only a place to rest 
But that was reserved for Conrad's Great Guest 
But her voice seemed to plead, "Don't send me away 
Let me rest for awhile on Christmas day."
So Conrad brewed her a steaming cup 
And told her to sit at the table and sup 
But after she left he was filled with dismay 
For he saw that the hours were slipping away 
And the Lord had not come as He said He would 
And Conrad felt sure he had misunderstood.
When out of the stillness he heard a cry 
"Please help me and tell me where am I." 
So again he opened his friendly door 
And stood disappointed as twice before 
It was only a child who had wandered away 
And was lost from her family on Christmas Day.
Again Conrad's heart was heavy and sad 
But he knew he should make the little girl glad 
So he called her in and wiped her tears 
And quieted all her childish fears.
Then he led her back to her home once more 
But as he entered his own darkened door 
He knew that the Lord was not coming today 
For the hours of Christmas had passed away.
So he went to his room and knelt down to pray 
And he said, "Dear Lord, why did you delay 
What kept You from coming to call on me? 
For I wanted so much Your face to see."
When soft in the silence a voice he heard 
"Lift up your head for I kept My word 
Three times My shadow crossed your floor 
Three times I came to your lowly door.
For I was the beggar with bruised, cold feet 
I was the woman you gave something to eat 
And I was the child on the homeless street.
Three times I knocked and three times I came in 
And each time I found the warmth of a friend 
Of all the gifts, love is the best 
I was honored to be your Christmas Guest."

Jack Frost nipping at your nose 
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir 
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe 
Help to make the season bright 
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow 
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.
They know that Santa's on his way 
He's bringing lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh 
And every mother's child is gonna spy 
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.
And so I'm offering this simple phrase 
To kids from one to ninety-two 
Although it's been said many times, many ways 
Merry Christmas to you.
And so I'm offering this simple phrase 
To kids from one to ninety-two 
Although it's been said many times, many ways 
Merry Christmas to you.

With no one to miss us 
On our own 
Out in the cold. 
Trudging onward 
Braving a harsh winter storm 
You and I met passing by 
And now our spirits feel warm. 

I don't have anyone at home to talk to 
And you don't have anything to do 
So I'll spend my Christmas with you 
I'll spend my Christmas with you 
I'll spend my Christmas with you. 

It's Christmas and we are in love 
With the way that the soft snowflakes kiss us 
From far above 
The blustery breeze 
Trudging onward 
Braving a harsh winter storm 
You and I met passing by 
And now our spirits feel warm. 

I believe that Jesus is truly the only way 
I celebrate Christmas because it's His birthday. 
I don't have anyone at home to talk to 
And you don't have anything to do 
So, I'll spend my Christmas with you 
I'll spend my Christmas with you 
I'll spend my Christmas with you 
I'll spend my Christmas with you. 

Was humbly born in a stable rude 
And the friendly beasts around Him stood 
Jesus, our Brother, strong and good.
"I," said the donkey, shaggy and brown 
"I carried His mother uphill and down 
I carried His mother to Bethlehem town 
I" said the donkey, shaggy and brown.
"I," said the cow, all white and red 
"I gave Him my manger for His bed 
I gave Him hay to pillow His head 
I," said the cow, all white and red.
"I," said the sheep with curly horn 
"I gave Him my wool for His blanket warm 
He wore my coat on Christmas morn 
I," said the sheep with curly horn.
"I," said the dove, from the rafters high 
"I cooed Him to sleep that He should not cry 
We cooed Him to sleep, my mate and I 
I," said the dove, from the rafters high.
Thus all the beasts, by some good spell 
In the stable dark were glad to tell 
Of the gifts they gave Emmanuel 
The gifts they gave Emmanuel.

She stopped for to rest by the road side 
Where a bird with a broken wing lay.
A few moments passed till she saw it 
For it's feathers were covered with sand 
And soon clean and wrapped it was traveling 
In the warmth of Maria's small hand.
She happily gave her last peso 
On a cage made of freshes and twine 
She fed it loose corn from the market 
Watched it grow stronger with time.
Now the gift giving service was coming 
And the church armed with tinsel and light 
And all of the town folk brought presents 
To lay by the manger that night.
There were diamonds, incense and perfumes 
And packages fit for a king 
But for one ragged bird in his small cage 
Maria had nothing to bring.
She waited till just before midnight 
So no one would see her go in 
And crying she knelt by the manger 
For her gift was unworthy of him.
Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness 
"Maria, what brings you to me? 
If the bird in the cage is your offering 
Open the door, let me see."
So she trembled, she did as He asked her 
And out of the cage the bird flew 
Soaring up into the rafters 
On a wing that had healed good as new.
And just then the midnight bells rang out 
And the little bird started to sing 
A song that no words could recapture 
For its beauty was fit for a king.
Now Maria felt blessed just to listen 
To the cascade of notes sweet and long 
As her offering was lifted to heaven 
By the very first nightingale's song.

You and I are waiting 
For Santa Claus to come.
There's a present by the tree 
Stockings on the wall 
Knowing you're in love with me 
Is the greatest gift of all.
The fire is slowly fading 
Chill is in the air 
All the gifts are waiting 
For children everywhere.
Through the window I can see 
Snow begin to fall 
Knowing you're in love with me 
Is the greatest gift of all.
Just before I go to sleep 
I hear a church bell ring 
Merry Christmas everyone 
Is the song it sings.
So, I say a silent prayer 
For creatures great and small 
Peace on earth, goodwill to men 
Is the greatest gift of all.
Peace on earth, goodwill to men 
Is the greatest gift of all.

When they are both full grown  
Of all the trees that are in the wood  
The holly bears the crown.
O, the rising of the sun  
And the running of the deer  
The playing of the merry organ  
Sweet singing of the choir.
The holly bears a blossom  
As white as lily flower  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
To be our sweet Saviour.
O, the rising of the sun  
And the running of the deer  
The playing of the merry organ  
Sweet singing of the choir.
The holly bears a berry  
As red as any blood  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
To do poor sinners good.
O, the rising of the sun  
And the running of the deer  
The playing of the merry organ  
Sweet singing of the choir.
The holly bears a prickle  
As sharp as any thorn  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
On Christmas Day in the morn.
O, the rising of the sun  
And the running of the deer  
The playing of the merry organ  
Sweet singing of the choir.
The holly bears a bark  
As bitter as any gall  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
For to redeem us all.
O, the rising of the sun  
And the running of the deer  
The playing of the merry organ  
Sweet singing of the choir.
The holly and the ivy  
Now both are full well grown  
Of all the trees that are in the wood  
The holly bears the crown.
O, the rising of the sun  
And the running of the deer  
The playing of the merry organ  
Sweet singing of the choir. 


And goodness knows  
He didn't want a lot.
He sent a note to Santa 
For some soldiers and a drum 
It broke his little heart  
When he found Santa hadn't come.
In the street, he envies all those lucky boys 
Then wanders home to last year's broken toys 
I'm so sorry for that laddie 
He hasn't got a daddy 
The little boy that Santa Claus forgot.
Spoken: 
You know, Christmas comes but once a year for every girl and boy 
The laughter and the joy they find in each brand new toy 
I'll tell you of a little boy that lives across the way 
This little fella's Christmas is just another day 
He's the little boy that Santa Claus forgot 
And goodness knows, he didn't want a lot.
In the street he envies all those lucky boys 
Then wanders home to last year's broken toys 
I'm so sorry for that laddie 
He hasn't got a daddy 
The little boy that Santa Claus forgot.

Who I am, who I am  
If anybody asks you who I am  
Tell him I'm a child of God  
Glory, the Christ child born in glory.
The little cradle rocks tonight in glory  
Rocks in glory, rocks in glory  
The little cradle rocks tonight in glory  
The Christ child born in glory.
Peace on earth, Mary rock the cradle  
Rock the cradle, rock the cradle  
Peace on earth, Mary rock the cradle  
The Christ child born of glory.
The Christ child passing, singing softly  
Singing softly, singing softly  
The Christ child passing, singing softly  
The Christ child born in glory.

All about an angel only four years old  
The littlest angel of all.
How all day he would play with a little box  
That to others had no worth  
Oh, but there were treasures in this little box  
The treasures he brought from Earth.
Just a butterfly with golden wings  
A little piece of a hollow log  
Two shiny stones from a river bank  
And the worn out strap of his faithful dog.
Then the angels all heard that the Holy Child  
Would be born in Bethlehem  
And they all brought presents  
For the Holy child  
And each gift was a heavenly gem.
Then the littlest angel put his little box  
With the presents fine and rare  
And the littlest angel sat alone and cried  
For his gift was so meager and bad.
Just a butterfly with golden wings  
A little piece of a hollow log  
Two shiny stones from a river bank  
And the worn out strap of his faithful dog.
But the Lord chose the gift of the little box  
That the child had blessed with love  
And it started glowing that very night  
It became the star up above.
When you see that star as it shines on high  
In the great celestial hall  
You will know the proudest angel in the sky  
Is the littlest angel of all.
With his butterfly with golden wings  
A little piece of a hollow log  
Two shiny stones from a river bank  
And the worn out strap of his faithful dog. 

And be thankful for all that we have 
All the lights and decorations 
Put up in the anticipation 
Of the joyful celebration 
That's on its way 
We're counting the days 
'Til it's time for Christmas day.
Oh, and God bless us everyone 
The good and the bad 
The happy, the sad 
Oh, and God bless us everyone 
Here's to family and friends 
It's good to be here again.
On the streets there're children laughing 
People smile as they are passing 
Christmas time is here, our waiting is done 
Wishing it could last forever 
Not just twelve days in December. 
Through the year let's try to remember 
That special way 
That everyone feels 
It's the magic of Christmas day.
Oh, and God bless us everyone 
The good and the bad 
The happy; the sad 
Oh, and God bless us everyone 
Here's to family and friends 
It's good to be here again.
So fill your heart with love and joy 
And through the eyes of girls and boys 
Share their wonder, live through their joy 
It's easy to do, just open your heart 
The spirit will come to you.
Oh, and God bless us everyone 
The good and the bad 
The happy; the sad 
Oh, and God bless us everyone 
Here's to family and friends 
It's good to be here again.

And he saw through the window a sight  
A big man in a chair 
And little tiny men everywhere  
He's the man with all the toys.
How thrilled that someone must have been  
And he must have been tempted to go in  
He stayed out in the cold  
And when he left them he told  
About the man with all the toys.
He's the man with all the toys.
The man with all the toys.  
He's the man with all the toys.

For millions of girls and for millions of boys  
When Christmas Day is here  
The most wonderful day of the year! 
A jack in the box waits for children to shout,  
"Wake up, don't you know that it's time to come out!"  
When Christmas Day is here  
The most wonderful day of the year! 
Toys galore  
Scattered on the floor  
There's no room for more  
And it's all because of Santa Claus! 
A scooter for Jimmy, a dolly for Sue  
The kind that will even say "How do you do?"  
When Christmas Day is here  
The most wonderful day of the year.

Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse 
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care 
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.
The children were nestled all snug in their beds 
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads 
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap 
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap.
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter 
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter 
Away to the window I flew like a flash 
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow 
Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below 
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear 
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.
With a little old driver, so lively and quick 
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick 
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came 
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name.
"Now! Dasher, now! Dancer, now! Prancer, and Vixen! 
On! Comet, on! Cupid, on! Dunder and Blixem! 
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! 
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all".
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly 
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky 
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew 
With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof 
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof 
As I drew in my hand, and was turning around 
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot 
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot 
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back 
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.
His eyes, how they twinkled! his dimples how merry! 
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! 
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow 
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth 
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath 
He had a broad face and a little round belly 
That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf 
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself 
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head 
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work 
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk 
And laying his finger aside of his nose 
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle 
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle 
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight 
"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"



When the boss busted in, nearly scared 'em half to death 
Had a rifle in his hands and cheap whiskey on his breath 
From his beard to his boots he was covered with ammo 
Like a big fat drunk disgruntled Yuletide Rambo 
And he smiled as he said with a twinkle in his eye 
"Merry Christmas to all - now you're all gonna die!"
The night Santa went crazy 
The night Saint Nick went insane 
Realized he'd been getting a raw deal 
Somethin' finally must've snapped in his brain.
Well, the workshop is gone now, he decided to bomb it 
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet 
And he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage 
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage 
He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger 
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger 
And he picked up a flamethrower and he barbecued Blitzen 
And he took a big bite and said "It tastes just like chicken!"
The night Santa went crazy 
The night Kris Kringle went nuts 
Now, ya can't hardly walk around the North Pole 
Without steppin' in reindeer guts.
There's the National Guard and the FBI 
There's a van from the Eyewitness News 
And helicopters circlin' 'round in the sky 
And the bullets are flying, the body counts rising 
And everyone's dying to know -"Oh Santa, why? 
My, my, my, my, my, my - you used to be such a jolly guy".
Yes Virginia, now Santa's doing time 
In a Federal prison for his infamous crime 
Hey little friend now, don't you cry no more tears 
He'll be out on good behavior in seven hundred more years.
But now Vixen's in therapy and Donner's still nervous 
And the elves all got jobs working for the postal service 
And they say Mrs. Claus, she's on the phone every night 
With a lawyer negotiating the movie rights.
They talk about 
The night Santa went crazy 
The night Saint Nicholas flipped 
Broke his back for some milk and cookies 
Sounds to me like he was tired of getting gypped.
Woah, the night Santa went crazy 
The night Saint Nick went insane 
Realized he'd been gettin' the wrong deal 
Somethin' finally must've snapped in his brain 
Woah, somethin' finally must've snapped in his brain 
Tell ya, somethin' finally must've snapped  
In his brain.

And the merchants' windows are all bright 
With the faces of the children 
And the families hurrying to their homes 
While the sky darkens and freezes 
Will be gathering around the hearths and tables 
Giving thanks for God's graces 
And the birth of the rebel Jesus. 
Well, they call him by 'the Prince of Peace' 
And they call him by 'the Savior' 
And they pray to him upon the seas 
And in every bold endeavor 
And they fill his churches with their pride and gold 
As their faith in him increases 
But they've turned the nature that I worship in 
From a temple to a robber's den 
In the words of the rebel Jesus.
Well, we guard our world with locks and guns 
And we guard our fine possessions 
And once a year when Christmas comes 
We give to our relations 
And perhaps we give a little to the poor 
If the generosity should seize us 
But if any one of us should interfere 
In the business of why there are poor 
They get the same as the rebel Jesus.
Now pardon me if I have seemed 
To take the tone of judgment 
For I've no wish to come between 
This day and your enjoyment 
In a life of hardship and of earthly toil 
There's a need for anything that frees us 
So I bid you pleasure 
And I bid you cheer 
From a heathen and a pagan 
On the side of the rebel Jesus.

And happy may we be  
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost  
To all eternity.

And Holy Ghost.
Chorus:  
Venite adoremus Dominum

Venite adoremus Dominum

Looked up and saw a starry light 
More radiant than the Milky Way 
And on their hearts such wonder fell 
They sang with joy: 
"Noel! Noel! Noel! Noel! Noel!" 
The air was dry with summer heat 
And smoke was on the yellow moon 
But from the heavens, faint and sweet 
Came floating down a wondrous turn 
And as they heard, they sang full well 
Those drovers three: 
"Noel! Noel! Noel! Noel! Noel!"
The black swans flew across the sky 
The wild dog called across the plain 
The starry lustre blazed on high 
Still echoed on the heavenly strain 
And still they sang, "Noel! Noel!" 
Those drovers three:  
"Noel! Noel! Noel! Noel! Noel!"

He came from the glory 
He came from the glorious kingdom 
He came from the glory 
He came from the glorious kingdom 
Oh yes, believer! 
Oh yes, believer! 
He came from the glory 
He came from the glorious kingdom. 


There's a star in the sky  
There's a mother's deep prayer  
And a baby's low cry  
And the star rains its fire   
While the beautiful sing  
For the manger of Bethlehem 
Cradles a King.
There's a tumult of joy  
O'er the wonderful birth  
For the virgin's sweet Boy  
Is the Lord of the earth;  
Ay! the star rains its fire  
While the beautiful sing  
For the manger of Bethlehem  
Cradles a King.
In the light of that star  
Lie the ages impearled  
And that song from afar 
Has swept over the world;  
Every hearth is aflame  
And the beautiful sing  
In the homes of the nations  
That Jesus is King.
We rejoice in the light  
And we echo the song  
That comes down through the night 
From the heavenly throng;  
Ay! we shout  
To the lovely evangel they bring  
And we greet in His cradle 
Our Savior and King.

We're following the star  
Shining brighter 
Old man, won't you help us 
If you can? 
He shook his head  
But he pointed his hand 
There's a new kid in town 
And he's lying in a manger down the road 
There's a new kid in town 
But he's just another baby 
I suppose Heaven knows 
There's a new kid in town 
Here in Bethlehem.

I see you've traveled far 
Bearing treasures 
You say these gifts  
Are for the new Kings pleasures 
Well, I've heard  
That a King might come 
But up 'til now there hasn't been one.
There's a new kid in town 
And he's lying in a manger down the road 
There's a new kid in town 
But he's just another baby 
I suppose Heaven knows 
There's a new kid in town 
Here in Bethlehem.
There's a new kid in town 
And he's lying in a manger down the road 
There's a new kid in town 
But he's just another baby 
I suppose Heaven knows 
There's a new kid in town 
Here in Bethlehem.

Home for the holidays   
'Cause no matter how far away you roam   
When you pine for the sunshine   
Of a friendly face   
For the holidays, you can't beat   
Home, sweet home.
I met a man who lives in Tennessee   
And he was headin' for Pennsylvania   
And some home made pumpkin pie   
From Pennsylvania folks a travelin' down   
To Dixie's sunny shore   
From Atlantic to Pacific, gee   
The traffic is terrific.
Oh there's no place like home   
For the holidays, 'cause no matter   
How far away you roam   
If you want to be happy in a million ways   
For the holidays, you can't beat   
Home, sweet home.

He rocked and He napped on His mother's lap 
And He wiggled and giggled and cooed. 
There were the cheers when He took His first step 
And the tears when He got His first teeth; 
Almost everything about this little Baby 
Seemed as natural as it could be.
But this Baby made the angels sing 
And this Baby made a new star shine in the sky 
This Baby had come to change the world 
This Baby was God's own Son  
This Baby was like no other one 
This Baby was God with us  
This Baby was Jesus.
And this Baby grew into a young Boy 
Who learned to read and write and wrestle with dad; 
There was the climbin' of trees and the scrapin' of knees 
And all the fun that a boy's born to have.
He grew taller and some things started changing 
Like His complexion and the sound of His voice; 
There was work to be done as a carpenter's son 
And all the neighbors said He's such a fine boy.
But this Boy made the angels sing 
And this Boy made a new star shine in the sky 
This Boy had come to change the world 
This Boy was God's own Son  
This Boy was like no other one 
This Boy was God with us  
This Boy became a man.
And love made Him laugh and death made Him cry 
With the life that He lived and the death that He died 
He showed us heaven with His hands and His heart 
'Cause this man was God's own son. 
This Man was like no other one 
Holy and human right from the start.
But this Baby made the angels sing 
And this Baby made a new star shine in the sky 
This Baby had come to change the world 
This Baby was God's own Son  
This Baby was like no other one 
This Baby was God with us  
This Baby was Jesus.
This baby was God with us 
This baby, this baby was Jesus 
This baby was Jesus  
This Baby was Jesus.

Is a beautiful place where the sun comes out  
And it shines in the sky for me.
On this beautiful Christmas morning  
If my wish could come true somehow  
Then the beautiful day that I dream about  
Would be here and now.

Wish your brother Merry Christmas"  
All over the land.

And we're all alone, there's no one home 
You're finally in my arms again.
The night is silent, the moment is here  
I couldn't ask for more, than having you near  
'Cause I love you, girl, and I always will  
And now I know the moment is right  
The moment is right.
Chorus:  
'Cause I've been waiting to give this gift tonight  
I'm down on my knees, there's no better time  
It's something to last for as long as you live  
Tonight, I'm gonna give you  
All my heart can give.
I thought I'd give you something shiny and new  
I tried to find something worthy of you  
But I realized when I looked inside  
There's some things that money can't buy  
Oh, no.
I feel the magic whenever you're near  
I feel it even on this time of the year  
'Cause I love you, girl, I always will  
And now I know the moment is right  
The moment is right.
Chorus:  
'Cause I've been waiting to give this gift tonight  
I'm down on my knees, there's no better time  
It's something to last for as long as you live  
Tonight, I'm gonna give you  
All my heart can give.
You know I'll always be true to you  
And you know I'm the one you can turn to  
Oh, yeah  
Anytime, anyplace, or anywhere  
You know that I'll always be there  
Oh, baby.
Chorus:  
'Cause I've been waiting to give this gift tonight  
I'm down on my knees, there's no better time  
It's something to last for as long as you live  
Tonight, I'm gonna give you  
All my heart can give.
Chorus:  
'Cause I've been waiting to give this gift tonight  
I'm down on my knees, there's no better time  
It's something to last for as long as you live  
Tonight, I'm gonna give you  
All my heart can give.

There's hope for all in this world 
Cause this is Christmas day 
Say a little prayer for the world. 
God, teach us love 
Though you think  
He doesn't hear 
I know He does. 
This is Christmas  
Let the world sing 
Let a soul began to heal 
Hallelujah  
This is Christmas  
And with love  
We can began today. 
Christmas bells ring  
People's heart sing  
And I forget 
About all the troubles  
I seem to have  
I tell myself to feel  
How my brother feels 
Try to love'em  
Then maybe I could understand. 
Make a little room in our hearts  
No heart's too small 
Can love each other today  
Cause after all: 
This is Christmas  
Let the world sing 
Let a soul began to heal 
Hallelujah  
This is Christmas  
And with love  
We can began today. 
Come come come  
See the Little One 
Come come come  
See the Little One 
Come, see the Baby 
Come, see the Baby. 
This is Christmas  
Let the world sing 
Let a soul began to heal 
Hallelujah  
This is Christmas  
And with love  
We can began today. 
This is Christmas  
Let the world sing 
Let a soul began to heal 
Hallelujah  
This is Christmas  
And with love  
We can began today. 

Could there be something you forgot? 
Beyond the bows, and mistletoe 
The tree with presents wrapped below 
There's more to this than you had ever thought  
Have we lost the reason that we celebrate each year? 
What is Christmas 
If there never was a Savior wrapped in a manger? 
What is Christmas without Christ? 
Remember how the story goes  
God's gift was wrapped in swaddling clothes 
Beneath the star, one great and holy night 
The shepherds heard the angels sing 
The wise man brought an offering 
Peace on Earth began in Bethlehem   
Have we lost the reason that we celebrate each year? 
What is Christmas   
If there never was a Savior wrapped in a manger? 
What is Christmas 
If the angels never sang "Glory to the new born king?" 
What is Christmas without Christ? 
There'd be no gloria  
In excelsis deo 
Gloria   
In excelsis deo. 
What is Christmas   
If there never was a Savior wrapped in a manger? 
What is Christmas without Christ? 
This is Christmas 
It's all about the Savior wrapped in a manger. 
This is Christmas 
Because of Jesus Christ!  
This is Christmas 
Because of Christ! 
Because of Christ!

And covered the village that lay sleeping below  
Thank goodness, this season will never grow old.
I look through my window well into the night  
Watching and waiting and hoping I might  
See one little reindeer fly through the snow  
Thank goodness, this season will never grow old.
Christmas is coming, may joy fill your home  
And the spirit be with you wherever you go  
Christmas is coming, may joy fill your home  
And the spirit be with you wherever you go.
Trees with full branches were the first ones to go  
I remember the children who came to the door  
And sang out the carols we all used to know  
Thank goodness, this season will never grow old.
All round the fire, the warmth of the flame  
Tip-toeing softly trying not to awake  
The ones who lie waiting for good things you know  
Thank goodness, this season will never grow old.
Christmas is coming, may joy fill your home  
And the spirit be with you wherever you go.

But down the road just out of town  
There's more magic to be found  
The countryside is all aglow  
With holly trees and mistletoe 
And in them woods there lives a bear  
Known to all as Thistlehair. 
Oh Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin' the good news everywhere  
About Christmas time and what it means   
To all the children of the world  
Every little boy and girl out there   
Loves Thistlehair.
He comes around this time of year  
Spreading lots of Christmas cheer  
The kids all love his shiny coat  
And the smell of honey on his nose  
He tells them all about the star  
And everything that it stands for  
The birthday we all celebrate  
Is still our favorite holiday. 
Oh Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin' the good news everywhere  
About Christmas time and what it means   
To all the children of the world  
Every little boy and girl out there   
Loves Thistlehair.
Wherever you find old Thistlehair  
There'll be music in the air 
He dances 'round the Christmas tree  
Every single Christmas Eve   
Then he and all his furry friends  
Gather 'round the fire again 
Singin' 'bout the Angels' wings  
And the gifts of love that Christmas brings.
Oh Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin' the good news everywhere  
About Christmas time and what it means   
To all the children of the world  
Every little boy and girl out there   
Loves Thistlehair.
Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
La la la la la   
La la la la la   
La la la la la!
Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
La la la la la 
La la la la la  
La la la la la!

I would my true love did so chance  
To see the legend of my play  
To call my true love to my dance.
Chorus:  
Sing, oh! my love, oh! my love 
My love, my love  
This have I done for my true love.
Then was I born of a virgin pure  
Of her I took fleshly substance  
Thus was I knit to man's nature  
To call my true love to my dance. 
Chorus
In a manger laid, and wrapped I was  
So very poor, this was my chance  
Betwixt an ox and a silly poor ass  
To call my true love to my dance. 
Chorus
Then afterwards baptized I was  
The Holy Ghost on me did glance  
My Father's voice heard from above  
To call my true love to my dance. 
Chorus
Into the desert I was led  
Where I fasted without substance  
The Devil bade me make stones my bread  
To have me break my true love's dance. 
Chorus
The Jews on me they made great suit  
And with me made great variance  
Because they loved darkness rather than light  
To call my true love to my dance. 
Chorus
For thirty pence Judas me sold  
His covetousness for to advance  
Mark whom I kiss, the same do hold  
The same is he, who shall lead the dance. 
Chorus
Before Pilate the Jews me brought  
Where Barabbas had deliverance  
They scourged me and set me at naught  
Judged me to die to lead the dance. 
Chorus
Then on the cross hanged I was  
Where a spear my heart did glance  
There issued forth both water and blood  
To call my true love to my dance. 
Chorus
Then down to hell I took my way  
For my true love's deliverance  
And rose again on the third day  
Up to my true love and the dance. 
Chorus
Then up to heaven I did ascend  
Where now I dwell in sure substance  
On the right hand of God, that man  
May come unto the general dance. 
Chorus

'Twas in the moon of wintertime  
When all the birds had fled 
That mighty Gitchi Manitou 
Sent angel choirs instead 
Before their light the stars grew dim 
And wondering hunters heard the hymn.
Jesus your King is born 
Jesus is born 
In excelsis gloria.
Within a lodge of broken bark 
The tender babe was found 
A ragged robe of rabbit skin 
En-wrapped His beauty round 
But as the hunter braves drew nigh 
The angel song rang loud and high.
Jesus your King is born 
Jesus is born 
In excelsis gloria.
The earliest moon of wintertime 
Is not so round and fair 
As was the ring of glory 
On the helpless Infant there 
The chiefs from far before Him knelt 
With gifts of fox and beaver pelt.
Jesus your King is born 
Jesus is born 
In excelsis gloria.
O children of the forest free 
O seed of Manitou 
The holy Child of earth and Heav'n 
Is born today for you 
Come kneel before the radiant Boy 
Who brings you beauty, peace and joy.
Jesus your King is born 
Jesus is born 
In excelsis gloria.

Every Christmas Eve  
In a western town  
Gather up the kids  
All the friends and family  
'Cause the holly's hung   
And the candle's bright  
Tuning up a fiddle 
On a moon lit night  
Roll back the rug  
So we can two step 'round  
The Christmas tree.
There's a jolly man  
In a bright red suit  
Did you ever see a Santa  
In cowboy boots  
Twirling across the floor  
Spurs a-jingling merrily  
As they sing those carols  
Soft and low  
We'll all be shouting out  
Cotton-eyed Joe  
Roll back the rug  
So we can two step 'round  
The Christmas tree.
Waiting 'neath the mistletoe  
You'll never get a kiss  
I never move that slow  
There's too much I could miss  
'Cause a western girl  
Can't be still  
And a silent night  
Is not for me  
Roll back the rug  
So we can two step 'round  
The Christmas tree.
Red bandannas  
Kelly green  
Silver buckles   
On a new blue jeans  
Jumpin' 'round the room  
To a yule tide melody  
I'm gonna be ready  
When Santa comes  
But I'm gonna be dancing   Till he does  
Roll back the rug  
So we can two step 'round  
The Christmas tree.
Waiting 'neath the mistletoe   
You'll never get a kiss  
I never move that slow  
There's too much I could miss  
'Cause a western girl  
Can't be still  
And a silent night  
Is not for me  
Roll back the rug  
So we can two step 'round  
The Christmas tree.
Roll back the rug  
So we can two step 'round  
The Christmas tree.


Was there any rare expectation  
Like there was some kind of somethin' in store?  
Did the sky have to hold back the thunder?  
Did the moon find new reasons to glow?  
Could the children somehow sense the wonder  
2000 Decembers ago? 
Were the sheep as amazed as the shepherds  
At the new star that light up the sky?   
Did the willow trees whisper excitement  
To the rivers and streams passing by?  
Did the joy ricochet off the mountains  
'Til it filled up the valleys below?  
Did all the world sense love abounding  
2000 Decembers ago? 
Was anyone able to look at the stable  
And not see a Child but a King?   
I wish I could hear back over the years  
As heaven and nature sing  
Heaven and nature sing. 
Did the walls of the barn start to tremble  
With a glory they could not contain?  
Did anyone wake with the feeling  
Of peace that they could not explain?  
Oh the love must have been overwhelming  
As it warmed everyone in its flow  
For all of the earth is still telling  
Of 2000 Decembers ago. 
Was anyone able to look at the stable  
And not see a Child but a king?  
I wish I could hear back over the years  
As heaven and nature sing  
Heaven and nature sing. 
 
Oh the love must have been overwhelming  
2000 Decembers ago.

The watchmen on the heights are crying: 
Awake, Jerusalem, at last! 
Midnight hears the welcome voices 
And at the thrilling cry rejoices; 
Come forth, ye virgins, night is past; 
The Bridegroom comes, awake; 
Your lamps with gladness take; 
Alleluia! And for His marriage feast prepare 
For ye must go and meet Him there.
Zion hears the watchmen singing, 
And all her heart with joy is springing; 
She wakes, she rises from her gloom; 
For her Lord comes down all glorious, 
The strong in grace, in truth victorious. 
Her Star is risen, her Light is come. 
Ah come, Thou blessed One, God's own beloved Son: 
Alleluia! We follow till the halls we see 
Where Thou hast bid us sup with Thee.
Now let all the heavens adore Thee, 
And saints and angels sing before Thee, 
With harp and cymbal's clearest tone; 
Of one pearl each shining portal, 
Where we are with the choir immortal 
Of angels round Thy dazzling throne; 
Nor eye hath seen, nor ear hath yet attained to hear 
What there is ours, but we rejoice and sing to Thee 
Our hymn of joy eternally.

It's the warm and fuzzy time of year.
Snow flakes fall the temp is dropping   
Families out together shopping  
It's the warm and fuzzy time of year.
Elves are working overtime   
Making all our toys   
Reindeer hooves on all the roofs   
Of good little girls and boys.
Big old cups of steaming cider   
Fall asleep by a cozy fire   
It's the warm and fuzzy time of year.

What its signs of promise are?
Traveler, o'er yon mountain's height 
See that glory beaming star.
Watchman, does its beauteous ray 
Aught of joy or hope foretell?
Traveler, yes, it brings the day 
Promised day of Israel.
Watchman, tell us of the night 
Higher yet that star ascends.
Traveler, blessedness and light 
Peace and truth its course portends.
Watchman, will its beams alone 
Gild the spot that gave them birth?
Traveler, ages are its own 
See, it bursts o'er all the earth.
Watchman, tell us of the night 
For the morning seems to dawn.
Traveler, darkness takes its flight 
Doubt and terror are withdrawn.
Watchman, let thy wanderings cease 
Hie thee to thy quiet home.
Traveler, lo! the Prince of Peace 
Lo! the Son of God is come!

Put up the tree   
Before my spirit falls again  
Fill up the stocking  
I may be rushing things   
But deck the halls again now.  
For we need a little Christmas  
Right this very minute  
Candles in the window  
Carols at the spinet.
Yes, we need a little Christmas  
Right this very minute  
It hasn't snowed a single flurry  
But Santa, dear, we're in a hurry!  
So, climb down the chimney  
Turn on the brightest string of light   
I've ever seen  
Slice up the fruitcake  
It's time we hung some tinsel   
On that evergreen bough.  
For I've grown a little leaner  
Grown a little colder  
Grown a little sadder  
Grown a little older  
And I need a little angel  
Sitting on my shoulder  
Need a little Christmas now! 
For we need a little music  
Need a little laughter  
Need a little singing  
Ringing through the rafter  
And we need a little snappy  
Happy ever after  
Need a little Christmas now! 


Bearing gifts we traverse afar  
Field and fountain, moor and mountain  
Following yonder star.
O star of wonder, star of light  
Star with royal beauty bright  
Westward leading, still proceeding  
Guide us to thy perfect light.
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain  
Gold I bring, to crown Him again  
King forever, ceasing never  
Over us all to reign.
O star of wonder, star of light  
Star with royal beauty bright  
Westward leading, still proceeding  
Guide us to thy perfect light.
Frankincense to offer have I  
Incense owns a Deity nigh  
Prayer and praising, voices raising  
Worshiping God on high.
O star of wonder, star of light  
Star with royal beauty bright  
Westward leading, still proceeding  
Guide us to thy perfect light.
Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume  
Breathes a life of gathering gloom  
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying  
Sealed in the stone cold tomb.
O star of wonder, star of light  
Star with royal beauty bright  
Westward leading, still proceeding  
Guide us to thy perfect light.
Glorious now behold Him arise  
King and God and Sacrifice  
Alleluia, Alleluia  
Sounds through the earth and skies.
O star of wonder, star of light  
Star with royal beauty bright  
Westward leading, still proceeding  
Guide us to thy perfect light.

Christmas day.

Good people all, this Christmas time  
Consider well and bear in mind  
What our good God for us has done  
In sending His beloved Son.
With thankful heart we should pray  
To God with love this Christmas day  
In Bethlehem upon that morn  
There was a blessed Messiah born!
The night before that happy tide  
The noble virgin and her guide  
Were long time seeking up and down  
To find a lodging in the town.
But mark how all things came to pass  
From every door repelled, alas!  
As long foretold, their refuge all  
Was but an humble oxen's stall.
There were three wise men from afar  
Directed by a glorious star  
And on they wandered night and day  
Until they came where Jesus lay.
And when they came unto that place  
Where our beloved Messiah was  
They humbly cast them at His feet  
With gifts of gold and incense sweet.
Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep  
Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep  
To whom God's angels did appear  
Which put the shepherds in great fear.
"Prepare and go", the angels said  
"To Bethlehem, be not afraid  
For there you'll find, this happy morn  
A princely babe, sweet Jesus born".
With happy heart and joyful mind  
The shepherds went the babe to find  
And as God's angel had foretold  
They did our Saviour Christ behold.
Within a manger He was laid  
And by His side the virgin maid  
Attending on the Lord of life  
Who came on earth to end all strife.

Will I be with you or will I be among the missing?
Maybe it's much too early in the game  
Ooh, but I thought I'd ask you just the same  
What are you doing New Year's  
New Year's eve?
Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight  
When it's exactly twelve o'clock that night  
Welcoming in the New Year  
New Year's eve?
Maybe I'm crazy to suppose  
I'd ever be the one you chose  
Out of a thousand invitations  
You received.
Ooh, but in case I stand one little chance  
Here comes the jackpot question in advance:  
What are you doing New Year's  
New Year's Eve?

On Mary's lap is sleeping?  
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet  
While shepherds watch are keeping?
Chorus:  
This, this is Christ the King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, haste, to bring him laud  
The Babe, the Son of Mary.
Why lies he in such mean estate  
Where ox and ass are feeding?  
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here  
The silent World is pleading.
Chorus:  
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through  
The cross be borne for me, for you  
Hail, hail the Word made flesh  
The Babe, the Son of Mary.
So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh  
Come peasant, king to own Him  
The King of kings salvation brings  
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
Chorus:  
Raise, raise a song on high  
The virgin sings her lullaby.  
Joy, joy for Christ is born  
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

Lots of mistletoe 
Lots of snow and ice 
Everywhere we go 
Choirs singin' carols 
Right outside my door.
All these things and more 
(All these things and more) 
That's what Christmas means to me, my love 
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Oh yeah, 
Oh yeah yeah.
And ya know what I mean 
I see your smilin' face 
Like I never seen before 
Even though I love ya madly 
It seems I love you more 
And little though you give me 
Will touch my heart for sure.
All these things and more, darling 
(All these things and more) 
Whoah! 
That's what Christmas means to me, my love 
Oh Yeah, aaah 
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Oh yeah ha ha  
I feel like runnin' wild 
Those angels and a little child  
Greet you 'neath the mistletoe  
Kiss you once and then some more  
And wish you a Merry Christmas, baby  
(Wish you a Merry Christmas, baby)
Oohh  
And such happiness in the comin' year  
Oh, baby  
Let's deck the halls with holly  
Sing sweet silent night  
Fill the trees with angel hair  
And pretty, pretty lights  
Go to sleep and wake up  
Just before daylight.
All these things and more, baby  
(All these things and more) 
Whoah!  
That's what Christmas means to me, my love  
(Christmas means to me, my love) 
Oh baby baby!
That's what Christmas means to me, my love 
Yeah, yeah yeah, oh yeah 
Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas 
Oh yeah 
Merry Christmas, yeah 
Oh yes!

The yuletide carol doesn't make it better 
Knowing that we won't be together. 
A silent night 
I know it's gonna be 
Joy to the world 
But it's gonna be sad for me.
What do the lonely do 
At Christmas? 
Oh, oh, what do the lonely do 
At Christmas time?
The children can play with their new toys 
While their little hearts burst open with joy 
And lovers can kiss beneath the mistletoe 
The choirs can sing those glorious songs of old.
But what is left 
Oh, for me to do? 
Now that it's Christmas 
And I don't have you.
What do the lonely do 
At Christmas? 
Oh, oh, what do the lonely do 
At Christmas time.
Oh, oh, what do the lonely do 
At Christmas? 
What do the lonely do 
At Christmas?
Oh, what do they do, what do they do 
At Christmas? 
Ooh, what do they do, what do they do 
At Christmas?
Oh, oh, what do the lonely do 
At Christmas? 
What do the lonely do 
At Christmas.
Oh, ho, what do they do  
What do they do 
At Christmas?

Searchin' for light 
In the darkness of insanity oohh  
I ask myself   
Is all hope lost?  
Is there only pain  
And hatred, and misery? 
Each time I feel like this inside  
There's one thing I wanna know 
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding? Ohhh 
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding? 
And as I walked on   
Through troubled times 
My spirit gets so  
Downhearted sometimes  
Where are the strong  
Who are the trusted?  
And where is the harmony? 
Sweet harmony. 
'Cause each time I feel it slippin' away 
Just makes me wanna cry 
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? Ohhhh 
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? 

Where are the strong  
Who are the trusted?  
And where is the harmony? 
Sweet harmony. 

'Cause each time I feel it slippin' away 
Just makes me wanna cry 
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? Ohhhh 
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? Ohhhh 
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?

What you gonna call yo' pretty little baby

Born, born in Bethlehem.

Born, born in Bethlehem.  
Sweet little baby, born in a manger  
Born, born in Bethlehem.

A tiny star lights up way up high  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a Child is born.
A silent wish sails the seven seas  
The winds of change whisper in the trees 
And the walls of doubt crumble, tossed and torn  
This comes to pass, when a Child is born.
A rosy hue settles all around  
You got the feel, you're on solid ground  
For a spell or two no one seems forlorn  
This comes to pass, when a Child is born.
Spoken part: 
And all of this happens because the world is waiting 
Waiting for one Child  
Black, white, yellow, no-one knows  
But a Child that will grow up and turn tears to laughter  
Hate to love, war to peace and everyone to everyone's neighbor  
And misery and suffering will be words to be forgotten, forever.
It's all a dream, an illusion now  
It must come true, sometime soon somehow  
All across the land, dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a Child is born.

Hymns and carols, choirs are forming  
Everywhere that you go 
Père Noël, Père Noël  
Angels for every boy and girl 
Nobody cries or tells any lies 
The night that children rule the world 
When the children rule the world 
Tonight! When the children rule the world. 
Doves and kings and shepherds and wisemen  
Came together, followed the star  
They all gathered down in the manger   
They came from so very far 
Midnight is clear, the spirits are here 
Angels that guard each boy and girl  
No hunger or thirst, the last will be first 
The night that children rule the world 
When the children rule the world 
Tonight! When the children rule the world. 
All the greatest wishes are granted  
Let us sing, let innocence reign 
All the prayers are finally answered   
Blessed and free of all pain  
Towers of fire, rise ever higher 
Magical flags will be unfurled 
The power of song, the young are the strong 
The night that children rule the world 
When the children rule the world  
Tonight! When the children rule the world  
Père Noël, Père Noël 
Angels for every boy and girl 
The demons are gone, the young are the strong  
The night that children rule the world  
When the children rule the world  
Tonight! When the children rule the world. 
Père Noël, Père Noël 
Angels for every boy and girl 
The demons are gone, the young are the so strong 
The night when the children rule the world 
When the children rule the world  
Tonight! When the children rule the world  
When the children rule the world 
Tonight! When the children rule the world. 
When the children Oh  
When the children 
When the children They rule the world  
When the children Ooh, ooh, yeah  
When the children Rule the world  
When the children Rule the world 
When the children) Rule the world.



That even though it's far 
He'll find me Christmas Eve 
I guess that Santa's busy  
Cause he's never come around 
I think of him 
When Christmas comes to town. 
The best time of the year 
When everyone comes home 
With all this Christmas cheer 
It's hard to be alone  
Putting up the Christmas tree 
With friends who come around 
It's so much fun 
When Christmas comes to town. 
Presents for the children 
Wrapped in red and green 
All the things I've heard about 
But never really seen  
No one will be sleeping  
On the night of Christmas Eve  
Hoping Santa's on his way. 
When Santa's sleigh bells ring  
I listen all around 
The herald angels sing  
I never hear a sound   
And all the dreams of children  
Once lost will all be found 
That's all I want  
When Christmas comes to town. 
That's all I want  
When Christmas comes to town.

When it's Christmas time in Texas 
It's a very special time for me 
In Texas we'll be swingin' 'round the Christmas tree 
Dancin' to a Christmas melody.
When it's Christmas time in Texas 
It might look just like a Summer day 
There may not be snow in San Antonio 
But it's a Texas Christmas to me.
When Santa crosses over the border 
He'll sound a little diff'rent when he sings 
He'll hear those twin fiddles playin' 
Christmas songs with a touch of western swing 
There may not be snow in San Antonio 
But it's a Texas Christmas to me.
When it's Christmas time in Texas 
I love to hear those Christmas carolers sing 
People on the go, children's faces all aglow 
Wond'rin' what Santa's gonna bring.
Grandpa's been chasin' Grandma around 
Tryin' to catch her 'neath the mistletoe 
Everything is right, the Lone Star's shinin' bright 
And it's a Texas Christmas to me.
When Santa crosses over the border 
He'll sound a little diff'rent when he sings 
He'll hear those twin fiddles playin' 
Christmas songs with a touch of western swing 
There may not be snow in San Antonio 
But it's a Texas Christmas to me.
And we're wishing you all a Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas from Texas and me.


"Have you been good the way you should
On ev'ry single day?"
When Santa gets your letter
To ask for Christmas toys
He'll take a look in his good book 
He keeps for girls and boys.
He'll stroke his beard, his eyes will glow 
And at your name he'll peer
It takes a little time, you know
To check back one whole year!
When Santa Claus gets your letter
I really do believe
You'll head his list, you won't be missed
By Santa on Christmas Eve.

Except for kids who weren't that nice 
He filled their socks with ice.
Always in a jolly mood  
Christmas cookies were his favorite food  
His cheeks were rosy 
And his eyes were bright 
Especially on Christmassy nights. 
Santa Claus, Oh Santa Claus 
What a funny boy he was 
No one could quite understand 
Till Santa was a man. 
He liked winter more than spring 
He loved to laugh and loved to sing 
Christmas carols were his favorite songs 
He sang them all year long 
Fa la la la!
He wasn't all that great in school  
But in geography he ruled 
He could name every home 
From the North Pole to Rome. 
Santa Claus, Oh Santa Claus 
What a funny boy he was 
No one could quite understand 
Till Santa was a man. 
After school he liked to play 
On his papa's winter sleigh 
He was sure reindeer 
If someone would let them try. 
He always wore (pum pum) red suits 
He always wore (pum pum) black boots 
Even at the summer beach 
He kept them within reach.
Santa Claus, Oh Santa Claus 
What a funny boy he was 
No one could quite understand 
Till Santa was a man. 
He spent his weekends with the elves
Making toys all by themselves 
They learned to make such wondrous things 
While they'd laugh and sing  
Fa la la la la!
Lots of kids thought he was strange 
But they liked him just the same 
His joyful heart and merry way 
Brightened every day  
Fa la la la la!
Santa Claus, Oh Santa Claus 
What a funny boy he was 
No one could quite understand 
Till Santa was a man. 
Santa Claus, Oh Santa Claus 
What a funny boy he was 
No one could quite understand 
Till Santa was a man. 
No one could quite understand 
Till Santa was a man. 

Why can't I find you?  
Why have you gone away?  
Where is the laughter 
You used to bring me?  
Why can't I hear music play?
My world is changing 
I'm rearranging 
Does that mean Christmas changes too?
Where are you, Christmas? 
Do you remember 
The one you used to know? 
I'm not the same one 
See what the time's done? 
Is that why you have let me go?
Christmas is here 
Everywhere, oh 
Christmas is here 
If you care, oh.
If there is love in your heart 
And your mind 
You will feel like Christmas 
All the time.
I feel you, Christmas 
I know I've found you 
You never fade away 
The joy of Christmas 
Stays here inside us 
Fills each and every heart with love.
Where are you, Christmas? 
Fill your heart with love.

Glad tidings brought an angel bright: 
Refrain: 
How great my joy, great my joy 
Joy, joy joy 
Joy, joy joy  
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high 
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high. 
There shall be born, so He did say 
In Bethlehem a Child today: 
Refrain: 
How great my joy, great my joy 
Joy, joy joy 
Joy, joy joy  
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high 
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high. 
There shall He lie in manger mean 
Who shall redeem the world from sin: 
Refrain: 
How great my joy, great my joy 
Joy, joy joy 
Joy, joy joy  
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high 
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high. 
This gift of God we'll cherish well 
That ever joy my heart shall fill. 
Refrain: 
How great my joy, great my joy 
Joy, joy joy 
Joy, joy joy  
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high 
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high. 
Lord, evermore to me be nigh 
Then shall my heart be filled with joy! 
Refrain: 
How great my joy, great my joy 
Joy, joy joy 
Joy, joy joy  
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high 
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high. 
German: Als ich bei meinen Schafen wacht
Als ich bei meinen Schafen wach 
Ein Engel mir die Botschaft bracht.
Refrain:
Des bin ich froh  
Bin ich froh 
Froh, froh, froh  
Froh, Froh, froh!  
Benedicamus Domino  
Benedicamus Domino.
Er sagt es soll geboren sein  
Zu Bethlehem ein Kindelein.
Refrain:
Des bin ich froh  
Bin ich froh 
Froh, froh, froh  
Froh, Froh, froh!  
Benedicamus Domino  
Benedicamus Domino.
Er sagt das Kind lag da im Stall   
Und sollt die Welt erlösen all. 
Refrain:
Des bin ich froh  
Bin ich froh 
Froh, froh, froh  
Froh, Froh, froh!  
Benedicamus Domino  
Benedicamus Domino.
Den Schatz muss ich bewahren wohl 
So bleibt mein Herz der Freude voll.
Refrain:
Des bin ich froh  
Bin ich froh 
Froh, froh, froh  
Froh, Froh, froh!  
Benedicamus Domino  
Benedicamus Domino.

All seated on the ground 
The angel of the Lord came down 
And glory shone around 
And glory shone around.
"Fear not!" said he, for mighty dread 
Had seized their troubled mind 
"Glad tidings of great joy I bring 
To you and all mankind 
To you and all mankind."
"To you, in David's town, this day 
Is born of David's line 
A Savior, who is Christ the Lord 
And this shall be the sign 
And this shall be the sign."
"The heavenly Babe you there shall find 
To human view displayed 
All meanly wrapped in swathing bands 
And in a manger laid 
And in a manger laid."
Thus spake the seraph and forthwith 
Appeared a shining throng 
Of angels praising God on high 
Who thus addressed their song 
Who thus addressed their song:
"All glory be to God on high 
And to the Earth be peace 
Goodwill henceforth from Heaven to men 
Begin and never cease 
Begin and never cease!

Breathing a lesson unheard 
Hope with a gentle persuasion 
Whispers her comforting word 
Wait till the darkness is over 
Wait till the tempest is done 
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow 
After the shower is gone.
Whispering hope 
Oh, how welcome thy voice 
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice.
If, in the dusk of the twilight 
Dim be the region afar 
Will not the deepening darkness 
Brighten the glimmering star? 
Then when the night is upon us 
Why should the heart sink away? 
When the dark midnight is over 
Watch for the breaking of day.
Whispering hope 
Oh, how welcome thy voice 
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice.
Hope, as an anchor so steadfast 
Rends the dark veil for the soul 
Whither the Master has entered 
Robbing the grave of its goal 
Come then, O come, glad fruition 
Come to my sad weary heart 
Come, O Thou blest hope of glory 
Never, O never depart.
Whispering hope 
Oh, how welcome thy voice 
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice.

Just like the ones I used to know 
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen 
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
With every Christmas card I write 
May your days be merry and bright 
And may all your Christmases be white.
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
With every Christmas card I write 
May your days be merry and bright 
And may all your Christmases be white. 

Have you seen the bright blue star?  
It fills your heart with wishes. 
Have you seen the candlelight?  
It shines from every window; 
Have you seen the moon above?  
It lights the sky in silver. 
Green is in the mistletoe  
And red is in the holly 
Silver in the stars above  
That shine on everybody; 
Gold is in the candlelight  
And crimson in the embers 
White is in the winter night  
That everyone remembers.
Have you heard the boys outside? 
When all the girls are skating; 
Have you heard their sweet hearts cry? 
For all this time they're waiting.
Green is in the mistletoe  
And red is in the holly 
Silver in the stars above  
That shine on everybody; 
Gold is in the candlelight  
And crimson in the embers 
White is in the winter night  
That everyone remembers.
Have you seen the children playing? 
Tiny hands are frozen; 
Have you seen them hurry home? 
When suddenly it's snowing.
Green is in the mistletoe  
And red is in the holly 
Silver in the stars above  
That shine on everybody; 
Gold is in the candlelight  
And crimson in the embers 
White is in the winter night  
That everyone remembers.
Have you heard that bells are ringing? 
Ringing at their story; 
Have you heard the choir singing? 
Glory! Glory! Glory!

But I just really like it 
I am hardly religious 
I'd rather break bread with Dawkins  
Than Desmond Tutu, to be honest.
And yes, I have all of the usual objections to consumerism 
The commercialization of an ancient religion 
And the westernization of a dead Palestinian 
Press-ganged into selling Playstations and beer 
But I still really like it! 
I, I really like Christmas 
Though I'm not expecting a visit from Jesus.
I'll be seeing my dad 
My brother and sisters, my gran and my mum 
They'll be drinking white wine in the sun 
I'll be seeing my dad 
My sisters and brother, my gran and my mum 
They'll be drinking white wine in the sun.
I don't go for ancient wisdom 
I don't believe just 'cos ideas are tenacious  
It means they are worthy 
I get freaked out by churches 
Some of the hymns that they sing have nice chords  
But the lyrics are dodgy.
And yes I have all of the usual objections to the mis-education 
Of children forced into a cult institution  
And taught to externalize blame 
And to feel ashamed and to judge things as plain right and wrong 
But I quite like the songs.
I'm not expecting great presents 
The old combination of socks, jocks and chocolate 
Is just fine by me.

Cos I'll be seeing my dad 
My brother and sisters, my gran and my mum 
They'll be drinking white wine in the sun 
I'll be seeing my dad 
My sisters and brother, my gran and my mum 
They'll be drinking white wine in the sun.

And you, my baby girl 
My jet lagged infant daughter 
You'll be handed round the room 
Like a puppy at a primary school 
And you're too young to know 
But you will learn yourself one day 
That wherever you are and whatever you face 
These are the people who'll make you feel safe in this world 
My sweet blue-eyed girl.
And if, my baby girl 
When you're twenty-one or thirty-one 
And Christmas comes around 
And you find yourself nine thousand miles from home 
You'll know what ever comes 
Your brother and sister and me and your mum 
Will be waiting for you in the sun. 
Girl, when Christmas comes 
Your brothers and sisters, your aunts and your uncles 
Your grandparents, cousins and me and your mum 
Will be drinking white wine in the sun 
We'll be waiting for you in the sun 
Baby whenever you come 
We'll be waiting for you in the sun 
Waiting... 
I, I really like Christmas 
It's sentimental, I know.


At Whose feet the shepherds fall?  
Who is He in deep distress  
Fasting in the wilderness?
'Tis the Lord! O wondrous story!  
'Tis the Lord! the King of glory!  
At His feet we humbly fall,  
Crown Him! crown Him, Lord of all!
Who is He the people bless  
For His words of gentleness?  
Who is He to Whom they bring  
All the sick and sorrowing?
'Tis the Lord! O wondrous story!  
'Tis the Lord! the King of glory!  
At His feet we humbly fall,  
Crown Him! crown Him, Lord of all!
Who is He that stands and weeps  
At the grave where Lazarus sleeps?  
Who is He the gathering throng  
Greet with loud triumphant song? 
'Tis the Lord! O wondrous story!  
'Tis the Lord! the King of glory!  
At His feet we humbly fall,  
Crown Him! crown Him, Lord of all!
Lo! at midnight, who is He  
Prays in dark Gethsemane?  
Who is He on yonder tree  
Dies in grief and agony?
'Tis the Lord! O wondrous story!  
'Tis the Lord! the King of glory!  
At His feet we humbly fall,  
Crown Him! crown Him, Lord of all!
Who is He that from the grave  
Comes to heal and help and save?  
Who is He that from His throne  
Rules through all the world alone?
'Tis the Lord! O wondrous story!  
'Tis the Lord! the King of glory!  
At His feet we humbly fall,  
Crown Him! crown Him, Lord of all!

I bought you Donna 
Ralph Lauren and Prada 
I know I made you leave 
Got a brotha beggin' please 
Got a brotha on his knees  
I bought you a two way 
I even left Shantae 
I won't cheat again 
I need you, my friend 
All a brotha want for Christmas 
Is to have you back right in my life.
Why'd you leave me? 
Why'd you leave me? 
On this Christmas  
Why'd you have to go? 
Why'd you leave me? 
Why'd you leave me? 
On this Christmas  
Why'd you have to go? 
Why'd you leave me? 
Why'd you leave me? 
On this Christmas  
Why'd you have to go? 
Why'd you leave me? 
Why'd you leave me? 
On this Christmas  
Why'd you have to go? 
See a man can never 
Can do what I do for you 
See I'm so confused 
Got me stuck on you 
My mama say  
Why do I deal with you? 
Said I'm a crazy fool 
And stay away from you 
I dissed my family 
Just to get next to you 
I bought you a cell phone 
Can't even talk to you 
All a brotha want for Christmas 
Is to have you right back in my life.
Why'd you leave me? 
Why'd you leave me? 
On this Christmas  
Why'd you have to go? 
Why'd you leave me? 
Why'd you leave me? 
On this Christmas  
Why'd you have to go? 
Why'd you leave me? 
Why'd you leave me? 
On this Christmas  
Why'd you have to go? 
Why'd you leave me? 
Why'd you leave me? 
On this Christmas  
Why'd you have to go? 
J-boog: 
I mean why  
Why'd you have to leave? 
I put the gifts under the tree 
And dissed my family 
I mean why? 
Baby I had the mistletoe under the doorway  
Waiting for you 
Why'd you have to go?
Please come back 
I don't know what to do 
Aw if I had one wish for Christmas 
It'd be to have you 
Right back in my life. 
Why'd you leave me? 
Why'd you leave me? 
On this Christmas  
Why'd you have to go? 
Omarion and J-boog:  
Had to get you the DKNY purse 
Iced out wrist shopping sprees 
I damn near did everything 
For you.

Followed the new star  
By its heavenly light 
Did the lambs fear the wolves?  
Did they lay down and sleep? 
Who kept the sheep?  
Who kept the sheep?
Did robbers not steal?  
Or did they fear the light 
That the shepherds had followed  
Night after night? 
Did they not stray?  
Did little lambs weep? 
Who kept the sheep?  
Who kept the sheep?
Under the new star  
The new Saviour lay  
In his dim manger  
He lay on the hay 
The shepherds that came  
Had a vigil to keep 
But who kept the sheep?  
Who kept the sheep?
Who kept the sheep?  
Who kept the sheep?

He sends His pure sweet love 
A sign from above  
On the wings of a dove.
When troubles surround us 
When evils come 
The body grows weak  
The spirit grows numb  
When these things beset us 
He doesn't forget us 
He sends down His love  
On the wings of a dove. 
On the wings of a snow white dove 
He sends His pure sweet love 
A sign from above  
On the wings of a dove.
When Noah had drifted 
On the flood many days  
He searched for land  
In various ways  
Troubles he had some 
But wasn't forgotten 
He sent him His love  
On the wings of a dove.
On the wings of a snow white dove 
He sends His pure sweet love 
A sign from above  
On the wings of a dove.
When Jesus went down 
Through the river that day 
He was baptized in the usual way 
And when it was done  
God blessed His son 
He sent him His love 
On the wings of a dove.
On the wings of a snow white dove 
He sends His pure sweet love 
A sign from above  
On the wings of a dove.
On the wings of a snow white dove 
He sends His pure sweet love 
A sign from above  
On the wings of a dove.
On the wings of a dove  
On the wings of a dove  
On the wings of a dove.


Bum bum bum bum bum bum.
This is my winter song to you 
The storm is coming soon 
It rolls in from the sea.
My voice, a beacon in the night 
My words will be your light 
To carry you to me.
Is love alive? 
Is love alive? 
Is love?
They say that, things just cannot grow 
Beneath the winter snow 
Or so I have been told.
They say we're buried far  
Just like a distant star 
I simply cannot hold.
Is love alive? 
Is love alive? 
Is love alive?
This is my winter song 
December never felt so wrong 
Cause you're not where you belong;  
Inside my arms.
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum 
Bum bum bum bum bum bum 
Bum bum bum bum bum bum.
I still believe in summer days 
The seasons always change 
And life will find a way.
I'll be your harvester of light 
And send it out tonight 
So we can start again.
Is love alive? 
Is love alive? 
Is love alive?
This is my winter song 
December never felt so wrong 
Cause you're not where you belong 
Inside my arms.
This is my winter song to you 
The storm is coming soon 
It rolls in from the sea.
My love a beacon in the night 
My words will be your light 
To carry you to me.
Is love alive? 
Is love alive? 
Is love alive? 
Is love alive?
Is love alive? 
Is love alive? 
Is love alive? 
Is love alive?
Is love alive? 
Is love alive? 
Is love alive? 
Is love alive?
Is love alive? 
Is love alive? 
Is love alive? 
Is love alive?

Lies a mantel of white 
A heaven of diamonds 
Shine down through the night 
Two hearts are thrilling 
In spite of the chilling 
Weather.
Love knows no season  
Love knows no crime 
Romance can happen 
Any old time 
Here in the open 
We're walking 
And hoping together.
Sleigh bells ring  
Are you listening? 
In the lane 
Snow is glistening 
A beautiful sight 
We're happy tonight 
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird 
Here to stay is a new bird 
He sings a love song 
As we go along 
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman 
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown. 
He'll say, "Are you married?" 
We'll say "No man, 
But you can do the job 
When you're in town?".
Later on, we'll conspire 
As we dream by the fire 
To face unafraid 
The plans that we've made 
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman 
And pretend that he's a circus clown 
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman 
Until the other kids knock him down.
When it snows, ain't it thrilling 
Though your nose gets a chilling 
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way 
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Walking in a winter wonderland 
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Walking, just a walking 
Walking, just a walking 
In a winter wonderland 
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

Dancing in the sky above 
Just for us 
It's Christmas day 
Something to believe in 
I believe the love 
That we feel for each other 
Is His gift to us 
And nothing will 
Keep us apart 
If we love 
With a Christmas heart. 
It's Christmas now 
This is when the eyes of our children 
Search into these eyes of ours 
How sweet they are 
What kind of world 
Are we gonna leave them? 
What we couldn't learn from each other 
We still can learn from God 
What a way to live 
What a place to start 
Bless us, please 
With a Christmas heart.


Trim the tree and wrap the presents 
Turn the Christmas music on  
This Christmas I'll be home
With bells on.
I've traveled around this country 
Crossed the waters deep and wide  
Made lots of friends and memories 
Brought joy to other's lives  
It's Christmas time again 
Another year has come and gone  
And I can't keep from wonderin' 
How the old folks are at home. 
I'll be home with bells on  
I'll be home with bells on  
Trim the tree and wrap the presents 
Turn the Christmas music on  
This Christmas I'll be home
With bells on.
When the snow is on the meadow  
And the sleigh bells jingle bright  
And the kids are singing jingle bells 
Around the Christmas lights  
As daddy stokes the fire 
And mama puts the turkey on  
There ain't nothing going to slow me down 
This Christmas I'll be home. 
I'll be home with bells on  
I'll be home with bells on  
Trim the tree and wrap the presents 
Turn the Christmas music on  
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on.



The spirit's up 
We're here tonight 
And that's enough 
Simply having  
A wonderful Christmastime 
Simply having  
A wonderful Christmastime.
The party's on 
The feeling's here 
That only comes  
This time of year 
Simply having  
A wonderful Christmastime 
Simply having 
A wonderful Christmastime.
The choir of children 
Sing their song 
They practiced  
All year long 
Ding-dong, ding-dong 
Ding-dong, ding 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Simply having  
A wonderful Christmastime 
Simply having 
A wonderful Christmastime.
The world is out 
About the town 
To lift a glass  
Oh, don't look down 
Simply having 
A wonderful Christmastime.
The choir of children 
Sing their song 
They practiced  
All year long 
Ding-dong, ding-dong 
Ding-dong, ding 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
The party's on 
The feeling's here 
That only comes

You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch  
You really are a heel 
You're as cuddly as a cactus 
You're as charming as an eel 
Mr. Grinch.
You're a bad banana 
With a greasy black peel.
You're a monster, Mr. Grinch 
Your heart's an empty hole 
Your brain is full of spiders 
You've got garlic in your soul 
Mr. Grinch.
I wouldn't touch you  
With a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole.
You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch 
You have termites in your smile 
You have all the tender sweetness 
Of a seasick crocodile. 
Mr. Grinch.
Given the choice between the two of you 
I'd take the seasick crocodile.
You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch 
You're a nasty, wasty skunk 
Your heart is full of unwashed socks 
Your soul is full of gunk. 
Mr. Grinch.
The three words that best describe you 
Are as follows 
And I quote: "Stink. Stank. Stunk."
You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch 
You're the king of sinful sots 
Your heart's a dead tomato splot 
With moldy purple spots 
Mr. Grinch.
Your soul is an appalling dump heap 
Overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment 
Of deplorable rubbish imaginable 
Mangled up in tangled up knots.
You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch 
With a nauseous super-naus 
You're a crooked jerky jockey 
And you drive a crooked horse 
Mr. Grinch.
You're a three decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich. 
With arsenic sauce.

I used to see heaven in your eyes 
Now angels are falling from your skies. 
The things we said were so wrong 
And I haven't held you for so long 
My foolish pride turns me inside 
Why did we tell all those lies? 
If you can reach for the phone  
You don't have to be alone. 
Outside the winter seems so cold (cold)  
Your heart is frozen like the snow (snow) 
And there's no one home to keep you safe and warm  
Your eyes are red because you've cried (cried) 
You fell asleep by the fireside (fireside) 
But there's one thing you should know  
On this Christmas, baby, you don't have to be alone. 
And I had only one wish on my list     
For me, you would be the perfect gift (yeah) 
There's nothing colder than an empty home (oh) 
And holidays were never meant to be alone (to be alone). 
The smiles we gave when our hearts were saved   
By each other's love and warmth  
That subsided now, no happiness around  
If I could only find a way to your heart. 
You don't have to be alone  
You don't have to be (no no) all alone 
You don't have to be alone  
(You don't have to be alone).

Sounds of forever 
Still around. 
Lovers in love 
Just like we were 
Cos being apart's a lonely sound. 
When people ask how we stay together 
I say you never let me down 
Yeah, you make it feel like Christmas 
Even when things go wrong 
I hear the sound of Christmas  
In your song 
All year long.
Look at the sun  
Shining on me 
Nowhere could be a better place. 
Lovers in love  
Yeah, that's what we'll be 
When you're with me 
It's Christmas day. 
Cos you make it feel like Christmas 
Even when things go wrong  
I hear the sound of Christmas  
In your song  
All year long  
That's how you know that it's true, babe. 
Just look at us now 
Part of it all 
Inspite of it all 
We're still around. 
So wake up the kids 
Put on some tea  
Let's light up the tree 
It's Christmas day. 
And you make it feel like Christmas 
Even when things go wrong  
Say it now  
I hear the sound of Christmas in your song 
All year long  
Yes, you know that I do  
All year long.

Each day is just like Christmas 
Anytime that I am with you. 
You're all I want for Christmas 
And if all my dreams come true 
Then I'll awake on Christmas morning 
And find my stocking filled with you. 
You're all I want for Christmas 
All I want my whole life through 
Each day is just like Christmas 
Anytime that I am with you. 
You're all I want for Christmas 
And if all my dreams come true 
Then I'll awake on Christmas morning 
And find my stocking filled with you 
And find my stocking filled with you.

The fireplace is aglow 
And outside quiet streets 
Are all covered with snow 
So darling, let me tell you  
On this day of days 
Baby, you're my Christmas present 
My Christmas past  
My Christmas always.
In the night, church bells ring 
Their message, a cheer 
And somewhere canvassing 
Soon Santa will be here; 
And this I swear 
As into your warm eyes I gaze 
Baby, you're my Christmas present 
My Christmas past 
My Christmas always.
So, on this silent night 
Let me hold you tight 
And make you know 
Just how good love can be 
There's no gift of hope 
And no treasure untold 
That's as precious 
As you are to me. 
The stars twinkle on high 
Our world is so fine 
And I wish you Merry Christmas 
And as you pour the wine 
For you, this toast, my darling 
As my glass I raise 
Baby, you're my Christmas present 
My Christmas past 
My Christmas always 
You're my Christmas always.

You never wanted the nice boys anyway  
And I'm of good cheer  
'Cause I've been checking my list  
The gifts you're receiving from me  
Will be: 

One - awkward silence  
And two - hopes you cry yourself to sleep  
Staying up, waiting by the phone  
And all I want this year is for you  
To dedicate your last breath to me  
Before you bury yourself alive.
Don't come home for Christmas  
You're the last thing I wanna see  
Underneath the tree  
Merry Christmas  
I could care less.
Happy New Years, baby  
You owe me  
The best gift I will ever ask for  
Don't call me up  
When the snow comes down  
Its the only thing I want this year.
One - awkward silence  
And two - hopes you cry yourself to sleep  
Staying up, waiting by the phone  
And all I want this year is for you  
To dedicate your last breath to me  
Before you bury yourself alive.
So, don't come home for Christmas  
You're the last thing I wanna see  
Underneath the tree  
Merry Christmas  
I could care less.
Don't come home for Christmas  
You're the last thing I wanna see  
Underneath the tree  
Merry Christmas  
I could care less.
Don't come home for Christmas  
You're the last thing I wanna see  
Underneath the tree  
Merry Christmas  
I could care less.
Patrick, in a lisp: 
Sweet! They've recorded a Christmas song!  
They must've spent a lot of money on this 
But this one time, this one Christmas I got this -  
Beeps 'Deck the Halls'

For some Christmas sharin' 
But I pause because 
Hangin' my stockin' 
I can hear a knockin' 
'Zat you, Santa Claus?
Sure is dark out  
Not the slighest spark out 
Pardon my clackin' jaws 
Uh, who there? 
Who is it? 
Uh, stoppin' for a visit 
'Zat you, Santa Claus?
Are you bringin' a present for me 
Something pleasantly pleasant for me 
That's what I've been waitin' for 
Would you mind slippin' it under the door?
Four winds are howlin' 
Or maybe that be growlin' 
My legs feel like straws 
Oh my, my, my, my 
Kindly would you reply 
'Zat you, Santa Claus?
Yeah!
Oh hangin' my stockin' 
I can hear a knockin' 
'Zat you, Santa Claus?
Yeah, say now  
Hey there, who is it 
Stoppin' for a visit 
'Zat you, Santa Claus?>
Whoa there Santa, you gave me a scare 
Now stop teasin' 'cause I know you're there 
We don't believe in no goblins today 
But I can't explain why I'm shakin' this way.
Well, I see old Santa in the keyhole 
I'll give to the cause 
One peek and I'll try there 
Uh-oh there's an eye there 
'Zat you, Santa Claus?
Please, please 
I pity my knees 
Say that's you Santa Claus.
That's him alright!!

In a cradle in the manger lies the Holy Boy.
Zion's daughter, with your sweet angelic smile 
Holding in your arms the Christ Child, resting for awhile.

Now high hope starts rising for another day 
With eternal love and justice finally on the way.
